# Methodology

This repository applies structured institutional pressure-testing to AI and DPI vision papers.

Core principles:

- Separate architecture from governance.
- Score institutional risks explicitly.
- Bind risk priority to operational workflow tiers.
- Define accountability boundaries across actors.
- Make governance composable, not rhetorical.

Artifacts are version-controlled to allow iterative refinement.

# Methodology

This lab applies structured institutional pressure-testing:

1. Extract architectural abstractions
2. Score institutional risks
3. Bind risk priority to workflow tiers
4. Define accountability and escalation
5. Translate into reusable conformance profiles

The goal is composable legitimacy, not narrative critique.

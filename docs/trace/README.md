# TRACE Method

**TRACE (Trust, Risk, Architecture & Conformance Evaluation)** is the DPI–AI Governance Lab’s named method for assessing DPI–AI systems, programs, and policies.

TRACE is designed to produce **auditable outputs**, not aspirational principles: a repeatable report structure, control mappings, evidence expectations, and an action-oriented remediation backlog.

## What TRACE produces

A TRACE evaluation typically outputs:

- **TRACE Report** (narrative findings, recommendations, and decision log)
- **TRACE Scorecard** (structured rubric outputs)
- **TRACE Controls Mapping** (what was assessed, against what)
- **Evidence & Artifacts Checklist** (what must exist to support claims)

## Where to start

- Read the method: `method.md`
- Review the controls: `controls.md`
- Understand scoring: `scoring.md`
- Use the report template: `report-template.md`

## Versioning

- TRACE method version: see `TRACE_VERSION`
- Lab workbench version: see `pyproject.toml`

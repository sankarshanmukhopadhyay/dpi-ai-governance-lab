# TRACE Controls

This is a **starter control set**. Control IDs are stable references used for traceability into operational artifacts.

## Domains

- **TRACE-TRUST-*** — trust, accountability, transparency, redress
- **TRACE-RISK-*** — risk identification, tiering, monitoring, response
- **TRACE-ARC-*** — architecture, interoperability, dependency, survivability
- **TRACE-CONF-*** — conformance, evidence quality, auditability

## Starter controls (v0.1.0)

### Trust
- **TRACE-TRUST-01** — Decision rights and accountability are explicitly defined.
- **TRACE-TRUST-02** — Transparency obligations exist (what is logged, to whom, and when).
- **TRACE-TRUST-03** — Redress exists (appeal paths, timelines, enforcement).

### Risk
- **TRACE-RISK-01** — Risk register exists with ownership, likelihood/impact, and treatment.
- **TRACE-RISK-02** — Monitoring and incident response are defined and testable.

### Architecture
- **TRACE-ARC-01** — System boundaries and data flows are documented.
- **TRACE-ARC-02** — Critical dependencies are enumerated (compute/model/vendor/legal).
- **TRACE-ARC-03** — Survivability under constraint is considered (withdrawal, restriction, sanction).

### Conformance
- **TRACE-CONF-01** — Claims are backed by artifacts and evidence expectations.
- **TRACE-CONF-02** — Controls can be audited independently (repeatable assessment).

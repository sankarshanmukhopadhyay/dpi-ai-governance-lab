# Decision rights and liability (working draft)

This note defines *who can do what* at runtime for DPI AI systems, and how liability should be made explicit.

## Minimum expectations

- Every deployment MUST name a **System Owner** (public authority) accountable for outcomes.
- Every deployment MUST name a **Model Operator** accountable for monitoring, incident response, and rollback.
- For any cross-entity data sharing, a **Data Steward** MUST be named with enforceable approval, logging, and revocation powers.
- Tier 2–3 systems MUST define a **Redress Authority** with time-bound SLAs and remedy powers.
- Tier 3 systems MUST define an **Independent Assurer** function prior to go-live.

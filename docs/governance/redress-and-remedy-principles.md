# Redress and remedy principles (working draft)

Governance is not real unless affected people can obtain **timely remedy**.

Minimum requirements for Tier 2–3:

- Clear notice: what decision was influenced/automated
- Contestability: a path to challenge the outcome
- Evidence: decision record + model/version + relevant inputs
- Remedy: reversal, correction, compensation, or escalation
- SLA: time-bound handling and outcome notification

The creation of highly capable, general-purpose AI systems marks the
beginning of a new era for our world. The pace of change is already
extraordinary – and it is accelerating.
This is a revolution that leaders cannot opt out of. Those who move fast to
deploy AI across their economies and institutions will gain a lasting
advantage. Those who do not will see their ability to influence events –
abroad and at home – progressively diminished.
This is why AI matters so much to the question of sovereignty today. The
systems that will define the future require massive amounts of capital, talent
and energy. They depend on global supply chains, and economies of scale
mean that frontier AI development is likely to remain concentrated among a
small number of actors.
Faced with this reality, many leaders are now asking what steps they should
take to stay in control of their country’s future. The instinctive response is
often to try to do everything at home – to build fully “sovereign” AI and treat
reliance on partners as a threat.
This report argues that while this instinct is understandable, it is also wrong.
Full self-sufficiency is too expensive, too slow and, for most countries, simply
impossible. More importantly, it misrepresents what sovereignty really means
in a digital, global and interconnected world.
Sovereignty should not mean independence from all others. Rather, it should
be viewed as the ability to act strategically – with agency and choice – in a
world that is irreversibly interdependent. In the context of AI, that means

being able to shape how systems are used in your country, having real
options over infrastructure, models and partners, and retaining the flexibility
to adapt as the technology evolves.
No state can dominate every layer of the AI stack. Leaders must make
deliberate choices about where they want to build strength and influence.
And by becoming indispensable in specific parts of the AI ecosystem –
whether in data assets, specialised models, regulatory standards, energy
capacity or talent pipelines – countries gain leverage across it, even if they
do not control it all.
Crucially, sovereignty must not become an excuse for avoiding frontier AI.
Failing to access and apply the best systems is itself one of the greatest
threats to sovereignty today. Countries that cannot use these tools will
become dependent on those that can – less able to defend themselves,
drive economic growth or deliver public services effectively. Isolation and
protectionism do not protect sovereignty; they weaken it.
Leaders should therefore resist the urge to own every model and data
centre, and instead prioritise securing access to frontier capabilities, building
domestic strengths where they matter most, and governing AI in line with
national priorities and values.
This is also a question about the kind of state we want to build. When I meet
with leaders, I often stress that governing in the age of AI requires
reimagining the state: its capabilities, its partnership with industry and its
ability to move at the speed of technological change. AI can make
governments more effective and more strategic. But that will not happen by
accident. It requires political focus, institutional capability and a strategy to
integrate AI into the government machinery.
The value of this report lies in its practical guidance on how to make these
choices. It provides a framework for assessing national posture across the
AI stack, lessons from countries pursuing different paths and a set of
concrete levers for expanding national agency over time.

Above all, it makes the case for confidence rather than fatalism. Countries
that treat AI as a central pillar of their national purpose, deploying it widely
and negotiating their place in the global ecosystem with clarity and
ambition, will not see their sovereignty eroded. They will renew it for a new
age.

Artificial intelligence is transforming the foundations of state power,
reshaping economies, accelerating scientific discovery and recasting
geopolitical relations. For political leaders willing to embrace it, AI is not
simply another technological wave but a foundational governing
infrastructure that will influence how states make decisions, deliver services
and project strategic influence. Countries that fail to adopt and deploy AI at
scale risk ceding their competitiveness and, ultimately, elements of their
sovereignty to those who do.
In the age of AI, no country can claim complete self-sufficiency. Developing
and deploying frontier AI requires enormous resources: billions of dollars in
compute, data and engineering talent, alongside hyperscale data centres
and cutting-edge semiconductors. These capabilities are overwhelmingly
concentrated in the United States and China, which together control more
than 90 per cent of global AI data-centre capacity. Most states will never be
able to build or sustain frontier AI infrastructure on their own.
The dependencies this creates are increasingly seen as either strategic
vulnerabilities or levers of geopolitical influence. Countries are left to
confront a choice about how to remain competitive in the AI era: join the
resource-intensive race to train the world’s most advanced models or focus
on deploying AI at scale, bolstering competitiveness through deployment
rather than domestic frontier systems.
This landscape leaves governments confronting two defining questions:
what is sovereign AI capability, and how can nations develop and exercise
it? In response, calls for “AI sovereignty” are emerging, presented as an
imperative to exercise exclusive control over frontier technology and its use,
to build domestic capabilities and to enforce stricter regulations on foreign
technology. Although motivated by legitimate economic and security
concerns, this instinct reflects a narrow and ultimately counterproductive
understanding of sovereignty: one that equates autonomy with full
technological control and treats interdependence as a vulnerability to be
eliminated.

A more realistic and grounded understanding of sovereignty that reflects the
realities of interdependence rather than the illusion of isolation is therefore
needed. Sovereignty in the age of AI is not a binary condition to be achieved
or lost. It is fundamentally a question of agency and choice – the ability of a
state to make deliberate, future-oriented decisions about how AI is
integrated, governed and used in line with its national goals.
Sovereignty is shaped by how well countries configure and negotiate their
position within an inherently interdependent technological system. This
requires balancing a persistent trilemma: pursuing control by investing in
domestic capability, accessing frontier capability through global systems,
and ensuring coherence across regulatory, industrial, fiscal and diplomatic
strategies. No state can maximise all three simultaneously. The task of
modern statecraft is to manage these trade-offs within the layers of the AI
stack in ways that preserve strategic autonomy and expand national agency
over time.
Effective AI sovereignty therefore cannot be pursued through isolation. It
must be deliberately negotiated. Governments will need to cultivate
domestic strengths where they matter most, secure predictable access to
frontier capabilities, design partnerships that preserve flexibility, and invest in
the institutions and talent required to evaluate, govern and adapt AI systems.
Above all, national competitiveness in the AI era will depend as much on
deploying AI widely across the economy and public sector as on building
frontier models themselves. For many countries, this path will deliver far
greater returns than entering the resource-intensive race to train the world’s
most advanced systems.
The choices that decision-makers make today will have considerable,
enduring consequences for their countries’ futures.
This paper offers political leaders and key decision-makers a practical guide
to shaping the strongest possible national position in this rapidly changing
techno-geopolitical landscape. It demonstrates that AI sovereignty lies not
in a futile pursuit of technological self-sufficiency but in cultivating informed,

--- PAGE 9 ---

strategic agency. It provides a new framework to help governments assess
the trade-offs at each layer of the AI stack, illustrated with examples of how
countries are tackling these choices today.
From this, we identify seven strategic levers through which governments can
expand agency in the age of AI:
1. Secure access to frontier AI models and compute. Governments
should prioritise accessing frontier AI capabilities. They need to formulate
a clear view on what can be done using internationally derived models
and sources of compute, and what must absolutely be done domestically
and how much compute that would require.
2. Accelerate AI adoption and diffusion across sectors. Countries must
ensure they are able to adopt and diffuse AI at scale. The value of AI will
only be realised when it is widely adopted across the economy, which will
bolster national prospects.
3. Aggregate and signal national demand to shape the AI market. Every
country is competing for frontier access, and global providers and
investors will prioritise countries that demonstrate strong, coordinated
demand for AI.
4. Treat interoperability as a core component of sovereignty.
Governments should prioritise building open, modular and interoperable
systems to improve customisability, avoid lock-in and enhance resilience
to better control their digital futures.
5. Build and scale smaller, efficient and contextually relevant models. Not
every country needs to build frontier models, but the use of open-weight
and small language models tailored to national needs can create
significant value.
6. Invest in talent and state capacity. Leveraging the opportunities offered
by AI requires a strong talent base, a workforce that can leverage AI, and
high levels of state capacity to deploy and govern new technologies
effectively.

--- PAGE 10 ---

7. Align AI infrastructure with sustainable energy planning. Countries
must ensure that their energy systems are able to support domestic AI
infrastructure now and in the future, as it will place increasing pressure on
national power systems.
Together, these levers form a coherent agenda for strengthening national
sovereignty in the AI era, one rooted in strategic positioning, deliberate
interdependence and the effective governance of transformative
technology.

Technological shifts have always redefined the boundaries of state power.
The ability to build, own and govern critical technologies has historically
determined who created value, who set standards and who exercised
sovereignty. Governments once directed much of the innovation that
shaped national development, but today private firms increasingly operate
at the technological frontier, moving faster than public institutions and legal
frameworks can adapt. Public authority now often sits downstream from
technical and commercial decisions taken elsewhere that can influence the
functioning of economies, markets and even state institutions.
Many decision-makers are unprepared for the scale and speed of change
now underway. Unlike previous technological waves, progress in AI unfolds
in days and weeks, not years or budget cycles. AI has evolved from a
specialised tool into a general-purpose capability embedded across sectors
and the core operations of government, affecting not only how services are
delivered but how decisions are made. An algorithm used in public
administration, for example, can determine who receives services and when
they receive them, how public resources are allocated and where
enforcement is directed. This in turn shapes not only institutional behaviour
but the everyday experiences and expectations citizens have of their
government. The choices governments make today about their AI systems
will determine whether they can expand capability in the future or find
themselves locked into systems that are prohibitively and politically costly to
change. In this sense, every AI-related decision becomes an act of
statecraft, with implications that extend far beyond technology.
AI further magnifies interdependence across the digital economy. Advanced
systems depend on scarce and highly concentrated resources including
hyperscale compute, global cloud networks, semiconductors and highly
skilled technical talent. These inputs are controlled by a small number of

of Power

11

--- PAGE 12 ---

firms and jurisdictions, and for many countries, especially those with limited
fiscal space, energy supply or digital infrastructure, this concentration
shapes the boundaries of what is possible.
The implications for sovereignty are profound. Economies of scale, high
capital costs and strong network effects (where systems become more
valuable and dominant as more users adopt them) mean that much of the
emerging foundational AI infrastructure is likely to be developed and owned
by a small number of countries and corporations. This centralisation offers
clear benefits, such as enabling global access to cutting-edge technology
at lower prices while ensuring strong technical security and reliability.
However, it also creates structural points of dependency and vulnerability. As
AI becomes essential to the functioning of public administration and the
wider economy, governments must ensure they have sufficient domestic
capability and credible fallback options to maintain continuity of critical
services, such as national security and health care, should external access
to compute or data infrastructure be disrupted.
These technological dynamics sit within a shifting geopolitical landscape. At
the AI frontier, the United States and China have emerged as the two poles
of AI power, offering capability and partnership on contrasting terms. The US
promotes a “trusted” AI ecosystem that is rooted in innovation, scale and
private enterprise, but reinforced through an industrial strategy that
combines subsidies with export controls to secure national security and
strategic advantage.1 As part of a new “promote” strategy, major US firms
are expanding their global footprint through international investments,
philanthropic initiatives and workforce initiatives.2
China advances a state-directed model that treats AI as a strategic public
good while embedding ideological alignment into governance and
promoting “openness” as a narrative to normalise its tightly controlled
ecosystem.3Through its Digital Silk Road initiative, China offers affordable,
turnkey AI infrastructure that lowers adoption costs while deeply embedding
Chinese technology and standards within national digital architectures.

12

--- PAGE 13 ---

This strategic alignment is already visible in practice. The UAE-US AI
Acceleration Partnership, for example, provides the United Arab Emirates
with secure access to US frontier compute by accepting export controls and
limits on Chinese collaboration.4 Other states, such as Singapore, are
experimenting with a more balanced strategy, engaging both Western and
Chinese ecosystems to diversify risk and preserve market access.5,6 Across
Africa, Asia and Latin America, governments face the same dilemma.
Decision-makers around the world now face two fundamental questions.
First, what does sovereign AI capability truly mean in a world defined by
interdependence and concentrated technical power, and how can it be
built? Second, how can states harness AI in ways that bolster, rather than
diminish, national sovereignty?

The earliest debates on digital sovereignty focused on data protection,
privacy and economic dependence.7 In Europe, for example, concerns over
growing reliance on US cloud companies led to new regulations designed to
assert greater control over foreign cloud providers and strengthen domestic
data governance.8 These debates, however, belonged to an era when
sovereignty was primarily understood through the management of data
flows and market power. In the age of AI, sovereignty debates have gained
new urgency, but many governments still frame the issue through a narrow,
capability-driven lens that misreads the structural realities of the AI
ecosystem.9
AI now sits at the heart of national competitiveness, public-service delivery
and economic transformation. It offers extraordinary potential to accelerate
scientific discovery, boost productivity and widen access to essential
services. At the same time, rapid advancements in AI systems, including the
potential development of artificial general intelligence (AGI), have raised
concerns about potential security risks, including in areas such as chemical
and biological threats, and the possible displacement of significant parts of
the workforce due to automation.10 These dual dynamics of risk and
opportunity have made sovereignty a defining concern of the AI era.
As the race to develop and adopt AI intensifies, it has increasingly been
interpreted as a contest for controlling both intelligence and the technology
that will define the world’s digital future. In response, many countries have
begun pursuing “AI sovereignty” by purchasing vast amounts of new
compute, investing in national energy capacity, supporting the creation of
new localised AI models and launching programmes to help domestic AI
firms.11 The paradox is that even as demand for sovereign control grows
louder, technology firms increasingly market “sovereignty as a service”,
offering localised clouds, compliance wrappers (regulatory, technical and
institutional safeguards that adapt global AI systems to local laws and
govern how they operate within a country) or hardware bundles that

Age of AI

simulate autonomy while deepening dependency.12 These arrangements
can create the appearance of control without delivering meaningful agency,
reinforcing why sovereignty cannot be reduced to infrastructure localisation
or the nominal ownership of digital assets.
As the Tony Blair Institute for Global Change (TBI) has previously argued in
Sovereignty, Security, Scale: A UK Strategy for AI Infrastructure, countries will
need some level of domestic compute capacity to ensure resilience for
mission-critical areas, such as health care or national security. However, this
requirement is often overstated in the pursuit of AI sovereignty. A baseline of
sovereign capability matters, but replicating frontier-scale capability is
neither feasible nor necessary for most countries.13 At the same time, states
that fail to adopt AI and deploy it at scale will find themselves rapidly falling
behind, not because they lack frontier models but because they fail to
convert available capability into public value. Sovereignty in the AI era will
depend as much on a country’s ability to use AI effectively as on how much
of the technology it builds itself.
Even for countries that could build their own isolated or sovereign AI
ecosystems, the AI supply chain is inherently global: semiconductors are
designed in one region and fabricated in another, cloud platforms operate
across borders, models are trained on proprietary architectures, and
technical talent circulates globally. Sovereignty must therefore be
understood not as independence, but as the ability to act deliberately within
an interdependent system.
Managing this interdependence, however, demands navigating trade-offs
across three dimensions: the degree of control a state seeks over critical
systems, the capability it needs to remain competitive and secure, and the
degree of coherence it can achieve across its regulatory, industrial,
diplomatic and fiscal strategies. In an environment defined by high levels of
global dependencies across the entire supply chain, AI sovereignty should
not be viewed as a binary choice i.e. sovereign or not. Instead, countries
must work to shape domestic and international AI strategies that align with
their strengths and weaknesses across the “AI stack” (shown in Figure 1).

15

--- PAGE 16 ---

Taken together, the layers of the AI stack illustrate the complexity of frontier
AI ecosystems and why many countries will be unable to excel across the
entire stack.
Policymakers must therefore evaluate their strategic configuration across
the stack, determining where to build domestic strength, where
partnerships can extend capacity and where managed dependencies are
advantageous. For example, energy-rich countries may wish to leverage
cheap electricity to attract the development of new data centres, and
countries with strong talent pipelines and pro-innovation regulatory
frameworks could become hubs for model development or AI services. By
focusing on the application layer, many countries can also build contextually
relevant use cases that deliver value while limiting the cost of supporting
and sustaining domestic model training.

Source: TBI analysis
Sovereignty in the age of AI is therefore a hybrid construct.14 It is a
continuum of agency that is defined by a state’s ability to make
deliberate, future-oriented choices about how AI is integrated, governed
and used in ways that protect public interests, create value, build
domestic ecosystems, and preserve fallback capacity if external access
is disrupted.
SOVEREIGNTY IN THE AGE OF AI: STRATEGIC CHOICES, STRUCTURAL DEPENDENCIES AND THE LONG GAME AHEAD
17

--- PAGE 18 ---

Strengthening sovereignty in the age of AI will require governments to
navigate a series of trade-offs across the layers of the AI stack. Decisions
made at one layer of the stack may restrict or expand options available at
another: compute capacity is constrained by energy supply, data access
affects model relevance, and governance depends on the skills and
institutions that uphold it. Collectively, these interactions define the decision
space within which strategic choices about AI can practically be made.
Compute Infrastructure: Autonomy Versus
Capability Versus Cost
Compute, the processing power provided by chips and measured in FLOPs
(floating-point operations), underpins modern AI, yet it presents one of the
most consequential trade-offs. The more autonomy a country seeks over its
compute infrastructure, the more domestic investment it must make. The
more it relies on external platforms, the more capability it can access but at
the cost of control.
Frontier-scale compute is dominated by a handful of countries and firms.
Taiwan manufactures nearly all advanced AI chips, while the US and its allies
provide core funding, software and hardware.15,16 China is investing heavily to
close this gap, but still lacks the scale and technological maturity of US-
aligned supply chains.17 As a result, the US currently hosts around 75 per
cent of the world’s total AI compute capacity compared to 15 per cent in
China and roughly 10 per cent distributed elsewhere, mostly in Europe.18
Only 32 countries worldwide host AI-specific data centres, leaving around
160 nations dependent on foreign infrastructure.19 TBI’s State of Compute
Access reports in 2023 and 2024 have found similar trends, highlighting the
divergent availability of compute worldwide.

capacity, followed by China

This scale imbalance means training frontier models is not feasible for most
countries. Yet domestic compute remains essential for resilience in critical
domains such as health care, core public administration and national
security. Decision-makers will have to decide how much of that compute
should be held domestically to ensure autonomy and continuity, and how
much can be reliably accessed via foreign cloud providers. The former will
ensure higher levels of autonomy and security at a higher cost, while the
latter offers scale and speed, but with less control and greater exposure to
external conditions and shifting geopolitics.
Energy: Scale Versus Cost Versus Control
Training and hosting large AI models consumes vast amounts of electricity,
and demand is skyrocketing. The International Energy Agency (IEA) projects
that data-centre consumption will more than double by 2030, reaching
around 3 per cent of the world’s total electricity use. AI is driving a significant
SOVEREIGNTY IN THE AGE OF AI: STRATEGIC CHOICES, STRUCTURAL DEPENDENCIES AND THE LONG GAME AHEAD
19

--- PAGE 20 ---

share of this demand growth.21 Goldman Sachs similarly estimates that
approximately 60 per cent of the energy needed for powering the growing
data-centre demand will require new generation capacity.22
As countries position themselves within the emerging AI economy, the cost
of electricity, available generation capacity and national energy mix will
increasingly determine their competitiveness. Crucially, countries enter this
new landscape from profoundly different starting points. Some, such as
Norway, the UAE, Saudi Arabia and France, possess deep structural
advantages including abundant hydropower or solar potential, extensive
nuclear capacity, strong grids and access to cheap capital.23,24,25 These
conditions allow them to scale energy supply for AI rapidly and cost-
effectively, making them attractive destinations for global data centres and
compute clusters.
Other countries face harder constraints: limited domestic resources, weak
grid infrastructure, high financing costs, or political and environmental
barriers to expanding firm generation (a continuous, reliable supply of
electricity). These inherited differences shape not only how much energy
countries can produce, but also how quickly, affordably and securely they
can expand supply in response to rapidly growing AI demand. Energy-
constrained nations must often rely on regional grids, long-term imports,
innovative financing models or foreign investment partnerships to secure
the power base AI requires.
Decision-makers must therefore determine not only how much energy they
possess, but how predictably and affordably they can expand energy supply,
and on whose terms that expansion occurs.
Data: Representation Versus Openness Versus
Sovereignty
Training frontier AI systems requires vast amounts of high-quality, machine-
readable data, but the global corpus is heavily skewed towards English.26
For example, in Common Crawl – an open repository of web-crawl data –
SOVEREIGNTY IN THE AGE OF AI: STRATEGIC CHOICES, STRUCTURAL DEPENDENCIES AND THE LONG GAME AHEAD
20

--- PAGE 21 ---

English makes up nearly half of all content, while major languages such as
Arabic represent less than 1 per cent and many other languages have
marginal representation.27 In addition, there is a finite amount of available
data for AI training, making access to high-quality data a major bottleneck to
AI progress.28 These imbalances mean that many national contexts, cultures
and languages are structurally underrepresented in the data sets from
which global models learn.
As the global supply of high-quality data tightens, countries are increasingly
treating their data sets as sovereign assets. Rich, representative data can be
used to fine-tune foreign models, build specialised applications, and
accelerate scientific and economic innovation. The trade-off, however, lies
between control and utility: tightly closed data sets may enhance
sovereignty in the short term, but this quickly becomes self-limiting when
their utility diminishes as their user base shrinks. Open or strategically
shared data sets maximise innovation and interoperability but reduce
exclusivity.
AI developers are already shifting towards more diverse data sources,
including proprietary or specialised scientific data sets, and extending
beyond text to richer modalities such as video and sensor data, and
synthetic data designed to fill data gaps. In parallel, countries are expanding
efforts to digitalise public archives, build national language data sets and
formalise public–private data partnerships that preserve trust while enabling
innovation.29
The question facing policymakers is not whether these data sets should be
made open or closed, but how they can be governed in ways that ensure
representation, preserve trust and unlock economic and scientific value,
without isolating domestic ecosystems or ceding strategic agency. The
appropriate approach will depend on the nature of the data set and a
country’s specific goals and objectives.

Models: Capability Versus Control Versus Alignment
AI models sit at the centre of national capability. Since the public release of
ChatGPT-3.5 in 2022, the predominant AI paradigm has been one
dominated by large language models (LLMs). Training a state-of-the-art
LLM, however, now requires billions of dollars in compute, data and
engineering talent, placing such efforts far beyond the reach of most
countries. Recent examples, such as the new supercomputer “Colossus”
built by xAI, illustrate the magnitude of the investment required.30 The
graphics processing unit (GPU) cost alone for Colossus 2 is likely to exceed
the $6 billion raised in its Series C funding in 2024.31,32 Over the next five
years, trillions of dollars will be invested globally in frontier model
development, with the US and China dominating both the capability and the
capital.33 An overview of the current distribution of the most capable models
is shown in Figure 3.
FIGURE 3

the US, followed by China

Most countries will remain dependent on the US or China for their access to
frontier AI models and foundational architectures. This dependence on
foreign AI models carries clear risks: opacity around training, decision-

making and model evolution, misalignment with national norms and limited
auditability. In sensitive domains, it creates potential security vulnerabilities,
such as “sleeper agents” or models that are more likely to suggest insecure
code to geopolitical adversaries.35,36 Accessing highly capable models
without oversight or fallback options can create long-term dependencies.
In response, many countries are experimenting with open-weight and
adaptable models, whose trained parameters are publicly available and can
be run and fine-tuned locally, such as Mistral in France and Falcon in the
UAE. These models allow countries to customise for local languages,
regulatory environments and domain-specific needs. Countries unable to
support their own open-weight or sovereign model initiatives can still assert
meaningful agency by distilling, fine-tuning or layering capabilities on top of
larger proprietary systems.
Ultimately, the key question here is not whether a country owns a model, but
how it governs, adapts and applies the models it relies on.
Applications: Build Versus Buy Versus Hybrid
It is applications, rather than AI models themselves, that will create
economic and public value. They determine whether AI improves
productivity and accelerates economic growth or whether a country falls
behind others that adopt and deploy the technology more quickly. As our
report Governing in the Age of AI: A New Model to Transform the State
emphasises, the transformative impact of AI on the state materialises only
when it is embedded into real systems of delivery, decision-making and
administration.
Governments therefore face a strategic trade-off between building
applications domestically, buying them externally or pursuing hybrid
approaches. Domestic development allows countries to embed national
norms, tailor systems to local institutions and retain greater control over
sensitive sectors such as health care, finance and public administration.
Buying applications offers speed and lower cost, but risks reinforcing
dependency, reducing future flexibility and embedding foreign standards.
SOVEREIGNTY IN THE AGE OF AI: STRATEGIC CHOICES, STRUCTURAL DEPENDENCIES AND THE LONG GAME AHEAD
23

--- PAGE 24 ---

Hybrid strategies, combining foreign-developed tools with local integration,
domain-specific customisation and domestically governed data, often
provide the most realistic path for countries seeking both capability and
agency.
Sovereignty in applications ultimately rests on who captures value and who
sets direction. Countries that already have strong sectoral institutions,
including health-care systems, sophisticated financial markets, advanced
manufacturing bases and research ecosystems, are uniquely positioned to
create applications that competitors cannot easily replicate. Those that fail
to adopt AI applications at scale risk losing competitiveness even if they
possess strong models. Applications are where strategic intent becomes
state capability, converting access to AI into national advantage.
Talent and Skills: Speed Versus Depth Versus
Retention
The emerging AI economy will demand new skills from the workforce. A
country’s ability to design, deploy and govern AI systems will depend on its
ability to cultivate, attract and retain talent. Building this foundation will
require sustained investment in educational institutions and partnerships
with the private sector, combined with robust research and innovation
systems that link academic excellence with practical deployment.
As global demand for AI skills accelerates, and with two-thirds of employers
planning to hire workers with AI expertise and 40 per cent expecting to
automate some roles, countries must race not only to expand technical
training, but to ensure their public institutions, firms and research
ecosystems have the expertise needed to adopt AI at scale.37,38
The trade-off in talent strategy lies between scaling quickly, building deep
expertise and retaining skilled workers in a fiercely competitive global
market. Kazakhstan’s partnerships with foreign universities, Estonia’s
SOVEREIGNTY IN THE AGE OF AI: STRATEGIC CHOICES, STRUCTURAL DEPENDENCIES AND THE LONG GAME AHEAD
24

--- PAGE 25 ---

integration of AI into the core of its education system and the UAE’s
nationwide use of generative tools such as ChatGPT each illustrate different
models of translating AI skills ambition into capability.39,40,41
Governments must rethink how education, research and labour systems
interact. The challenge is not only to produce more technical specialists, but
to ensure that institutions, from schools to universities to research centres,
can adapt fast enough to match the pace of technological change. As TBI
has previously set out, education systems must evolve to prepare citizens
for a world in which AI is both a tool and a competitor, while research
ecosystems need the autonomy, funding and continuity to anchor national
expertise.42 Doing both can create a talent ecosystem capable of sustaining
and governing AI over the long term.
Governance: Innovation Versus Assurance Versus
Influence
Governance determines how AI is developed, deployed and trusted within a
country, and how effectively a state can shape the external environment in
which it competes. Domestic governance frameworks influence adoption,
innovation, safety and accountability, while international governance shapes
the norms, standards and market conditions that govern access to frontier
systems. Together these dimensions determine how much agency a state
retains as AI becomes embedded across its economy and public
institutions.
The strategic trade-off in governance lies between flexibility and assurance,
domestic control and global interoperability, and innovation and regulation.
In previous research TBI has argued that decision-makers will have to craft
governance strategies that support innovation and AI adoption, and provide
guardrails and assurance to their domestic markets.43 Overly restrictive
regulation risks slowing innovation and deterring investment. Too little
oversight undermines trust and leaves systems vulnerable to misuse.
Governance also has geopolitical implications: countries whose regulatory
SOVEREIGNTY IN THE AGE OF AI: STRATEGIC CHOICES, STRUCTURAL DEPENDENCIES AND THE LONG GAME AHEAD
25

--- PAGE 26 ---

choices diverge sharply from major AI powers may find themselves
constrained in accessing frontier capabilities or excluded from emerging
global standards.
Getting this right will require policymakers to build credible institutions that
can evolve with technology. This requires regulatory capacity, technical
expertise, stable legal frameworks and active participation in international
norm-setting processes. States that balance innovation with assurance and
align governance with industrial, diplomatic and societal priorities will be
best positioned to shape the terms of their engagement with global AI
ecosystems, rather than simply absorbing rules and architectures built
elsewhere.

26

--- PAGE 27 ---

As the trade-offs show, each AI-related decision a country makes
strengthens some dimensions of sovereignty while constraining others.
These tensions cannot be fully eliminated, only managed. The scale, speed
and complexity of AI development mean that each state must navigate
these trade-offs and make strategic choices about which capabilities to
hold domestically, where to shape markets and norms, and where to rely
deliberately on others.
To illustrate these variations in practice, this paper proposes a new
framework for understanding how governments exercise agency in the AI
era: Control, Steer, Depend (CSD). This new taxonomy captures how
governments exercise agency within an interdependent AI ecosystem,
differentiating between postures of direct control, influence and managed
dependence that, collectively, define the full spectrum of AI sovereignty.
Importantly, countries rarely adopt a single posture across all layers of the AI
stack. Instead, sovereignty emerges from their unique configuration of
postures across AI systems.
The framework delineates three core postures:
Control: Direct Command Over Strategic Systems
Governments adopt a Control posture when they judge certain AI systems
as too critical to outsource. This strategic orientation is often characterised
by ensuring direct ownership, legal authority or exclusive operational
command over AI infrastructure, data sets or governance mechanisms.
Control provides the strongest form of insulation against external shocks,
but it is also capital-intensive and operationally demanding. More
importantly, control is not synonymous with nationalisation or autarky. Often,
it means ensuring that critical systems cannot be unilaterally withdrawn by
foreign providers, or that governments retain domestic jurisdiction over data.

Posture: Control, Steer, Depend

Yet overreaching for control can create inefficiency, duplication and isolation.
Japan’s investment in its FugakuNEXT supercomputer or France’s trusted
cloud initiative under European Union law illustrate control strategies for
compute and data respectively.44,45
Steer: Shaping Outcomes Without Full Ownership
A Steer posture allows states to influence AI outcomes without owning or
directly controlling the underlying system. Governments steer through
regulation, procurement, partnerships and the development of standards
that help shape markets and norms. Many countries also amplify their
steering capacity by collaborating through regional organisations, enabling
them to pool leverage and coordinate positions.
Steering is often the most practical approach. However, its effectiveness will
significantly depend on a state’s institutional credibility, market power and
geopolitical influence. Without the ability to enforce rules or shape demand,
steering risks becoming symbolic rather than strategic.
Depend: Managing Reliance on External Actors
A Depend posture entails reliance on foreign providers for core elements of
the AI stack. For many governments today, dependence remains the most
practical way to access frontier capabilities at speed and scale, and at a
fraction of the cost of developing them domestically. Dependence is not
inherently negative, nor does it automatically make a country worse off.
Instead, dependence should be shaped and managed strategically,
ensuring it enhances sovereignty and agency rather than undermining them.
This posture can be further divided into maker dependence and taker
dependence. The former is active and negotiated, with governments co-
developing systems or securing technology transfer. Brazil’s joint AI research
labs with China exemplify this approach by leveraging external expertise
while fostering domestic research ecosystems.46 India’s semiconductor
strategy similarly blends dependence with negotiated co-production and
SOVEREIGNTY IN THE AGE OF AI: STRATEGIC CHOICES, STRUCTURAL DEPENDENCIES AND THE LONG GAME AHEAD
28

--- PAGE 29 ---

technology transfer, aiming to move from full reliance toward onshoring the
semiconductor supply chain.47 In contrast, the latter is passive, with systems
adopted wholesale, with little to no domestic capacity to modify, audit or
govern them. This creates a risk of vendor lock-in especially where long-
term contracts govern mission-critical data and services.
Operationalising CSD Across the AI Stack
Applied across the seven core layers of the AI stack, the CSD framework
enables a granular, actionable analysis of where states hold influence, where
they depend on others and how they can improve resilience. Every layer
requires customised responses, not only in what is built or adopted but also
in the leverage and resilience it incorporates. Figure 4 illustrates this
application and offers a diagnostic lens for countries to evaluate their
postures across the stack and identify where interventions can most
effectively expand national agency.

Control, Steer and Depend are not rungs on a ladder, nor a linear
progression from “less sovereign” to “more sovereign”. They are strategic
postures that vary across the AI stack and evolve over time, enabling states
to expand agency and build resilience. A state’s ability to adopt any of these
postures, however, is shaped by its institutional capacity, credibility, alliances
and structural constraints. Sovereignty therefore emerges from how
effectively a country configures and progressively expands the set of
postures available to it, using them to strengthen bargaining power, manage
dependence and negotiate interdependence on its own terms.

AI sovereignty is determined by the strategic choices governments make
under real constraints including fiscal realities, technological capacity and
geopolitical trade-offs. The following matrix translates these principles into
action. It helps policymakers identify the key questions to consider at each
layer of the AI stack, the spectrum of available options and the conditions
under which each becomes viable. Rather than prescribing a single path, it
maps the decision space within which countries can exercise agency.

The following case studies (Japan, the UAE, Kenya, France, India and Brazil)
illustrate that there is no single path to AI sovereignty. Instead, states
exercise sovereignty across the AI stack through distinct configurations of
control, steer and managed dependence that reflect their political
economies, resource endowments, institutional strengths and strategic
objectives. Each country covered in Figure 12 has followed its own unique
pathway to maximise the opportunity offered by AI, while blending domestic
capacity building with carefully structured partnerships.
FIGURE 12

the AI stack

Sovereignty in AI is not secured through autarky or full-stack dominance, but
through a state’s ability to diversify options, manage its interdependencies
proactively and align technological choices with its national purpose.

Pathways Through the AI Stack

--- PAGE 41 ---

Distinctive sovereignty pathways appear across these case studies showing
how states translate AI ambition into architecture:
• First, advanced economies such as Japan and France assert sovereignty
through fallback capacity and governance credibility. Both invest in
domestic compute and modelling ecosystems while embedding
themselves within allied supply chains. Their strategies prioritise building
resilience via fallback capacities, ensuring national continuity if foreign
access is disrupted, and exercising regulatory influence through global
bodies such as the EU and G7.
• Second, capital-rich countries such as the UAE pursue sovereignty
through state-led investment and ownership, building direct control over
data, model development and energy, while striking high-value
partnerships with frontier actors on favourable terms. This model uses
capital and centralised coordination to secure proximity to the frontier,
ensuring that global capability is anchored within national jurisdiction and
aligned with domestic authority.
• Third, large developing economies such as India and Brazil exercise
sovereignty through steering power, using their sizeable digital markets,
growing technical talent bases and assertive state direction to shape AI
standards, incentivise domestic model ecosystems and attract strategic
investment. India’s leadership in AI talent and digital public infrastructure,
and Brazil’s combination of renewable-energy strength and regulatory
enforcement, illustrate how states can steer global value chains without
total self-sufficiency.
• Fourth, developing digital economies such as Kenya advance sovereignty
through negotiated dependence, leveraging alliances with major
technology actors to build and accelerate foundational capability while
embedding local governance, data protection and national priorities. This
approach shows how states with limited domestic compute or talent can
still expand agency by shaping the terms on which external capacity is
deployed, rather than passively absorbing it.

--- PAGE 42 ---

What sets states apart in the age of AI is not the lack of interdependence
but their ability to manage it. Countries that are best able to build selectively,
steer where influence is possible and structure dependence so that foreign
capacity supports rather than hinders their national goals will bolster their
sovereignty.
How Six Countries Configure Control, Steer,
Depend to Strengthen Strategic Agency
The case studies that follow provide a detailed overview of how these
sovereignty pathways are constructed in practice. Using the CSD framework
introduced in earlier chapters (with full findings set out in the Annex), they
trace how governments combine and recombine these levers across the AI
stack to build sovereign capability. The case studies highlight distinct
pathways: selective fallback capability in Japan, frontier acceleration in the
UAE, negotiated interdependence in Kenya, regulatory power in France,
digital-public-infrastructure-led scaling in India and state-guided co-
creation in Brazil. Together, they demonstrate that sovereignty without full
independence is both feasible and strategically advantageous, reflecting a
field of viable strategies shaped by national constraints and comparative
advantages.
JAPAN: RESILIENCE -FIRST APPROACH THROUGH SELECTIVE
INVESTMENT AND PARALLEL CAPABILITY STRENGTHENING
Japan’s approach to AI sovereignty centres on targeted investments in
domestic capacity building while remaining deeply integrated into global
supply chains. Rather than pursuing full-stack autonomy, Japan
concentrates on areas of the AI stack where it can meaningfully differentiate
itself, such as by developing fallback compute capability (Fugaku), building
culturally aligned open-weight models (Fugaku-LLM, Rakuten, Takane) and
strengthening trusted data infrastructure.48 This selective approach gives it
both frontier access and credible continuity in the event of external
disruption, reflecting a posture that blends control in priority areas with
steering and negotiated dependence elsewhere.
SOVEREIGNTY IN THE AGE OF AI: STRATEGIC CHOICES, STRUCTURAL DEPENDENCIES AND THE LONG GAME AHEAD
42

--- PAGE 43 ---

A central pillar of this strategy is resilient technical foundations. Domestic
supercomputing and emerging national GPU clusters, plus a growing suite
of open-weight Japanese models, form a technical backbone that can
support continued operations even if external access is impeded. Initiatives
such as the Generative AI Accelerator Challenge (GENIAC) and improved
national language training data also strengthen the foundations for culturally
aligned model development.49,50 These investments are complemented by
a governance approach that emphasises responsible, interoperable and
transparent AI systems, underpinned by the Act on Protection of Personal
Information (APPI), the Act on Promotion of Research and Development, and
Utilization of Artificial Intelligence-related Technology (AI Promotion Act) and
Japan’s leadership of the Hiroshima AI Process, a G7-led initiative to develop
shared principles, risk-mitigation measures and governance approaches for
advanced AI.51 This combination strengthens Japan’s international credibility,
positions the country as a credible norm-setter and enhances its
attractiveness as a base for AI innovation.
Japan faces demographic challenges and shortages in digital talent, as well
as structural dependencies in import-reliant energy systems. It confronts
them through active capacity building, such as through grid upgrades,
energy-transition strategies and structured talent pipelines. This dual
capability-strengthening model expands domestic capacity while
simultaneously leveraging global ecosystems to accelerate innovation and
assure frontier access.
Japan’s strategy contrasts sharply with faster, investment-led ecosystems
such as the UAE and differs from Kenya’s sequenced capacity building.
Unlike France, which leans on regulatory influence, Japan’s posture
emphasises resilience and continuity. Its approach shows how an advanced
economy with structural vulnerabilities can enhance sovereignty by
selectively reinforcing critical layers while leveraging international
ecosystems for scale.

UAE: FRONTIER ADJACENCY THROUGH ACCELERATED STATE
INVESTMENT
The UAE has pursued one of the world’s fastest-moving AI-sovereignty
strategies, driven by strong state capacity, centralised coordination and
deep partnerships with global technology firms. Its posture combines direct
control in areas relevant to national security with aggressive co-
development and frontier collaboration, accelerating its geopolitical
positioning as a regional AI powerhouse. The resulting hybrid posture means
that the UAE retains direct control where AI intersects with national security,
data governance and public-service delivery, while steering and co-
developing in areas that tap into foreign expertise or the ability to scale
innovation.
The country’s sovereign capacity is reinforced by highly centralised
coordination and state-led investments, most visibly through the
establishment of a dedicated AI ministry and flagship institutions such as
technology group G42 and the Mohamed bin Zayed University of Artificial
Intelligence (MBZUAI).52 What distinguishes the UAE is its willingness to act
early and invest heavily, turning its sovereign energy base, domestic cloud
ecosystem and political agility into strategic assets. Its open-weight Arabic
LLMs, such as Falcon, Jais and K2 Think, demonstrate how a country can
shape linguistic and cultural representation in global AI.53 These exemplify a
strategy built on speed and scale to attain frontier capability while
maintaining local jurisdiction and narrative control.
However, despite its ambition and strong capacity, the UAE remains
dependent on foreign chips and frontier models. These dependencies are
mitigated through long-term negotiated access, co-production agreements
and US-aligned security partnerships, which collectively secure reliable
compute and model access. By pairing strong domestic investment with
structured interdependence, the UAE mitigates risks while accelerating
frontier capabilities, turning external reliance into a managed asset rather a
vulnerability.

44

--- PAGE 45 ---

Compared to Japan’s resilience-first posture, Kenya’s sequenced
dependence or France’s governance-led model, the UAE prioritises
acceleration and global positioning that seeks frontier adjacency through
scale and ambition. Its trajectory illustrates how a small state with high
capacity can expand sovereignty through decisive investment and
structured interdependence.
KENYA: PROGRESSIVE CAPACITY BUILDING THR OUGH SEQUENCED,
NEGOTIATED INTERDEPENDENCE
Kenya’s AI-sovereignty strategy acknowledges its structural constraints
(limited compute, uneven energy availability and nascent model
ecosystems) but treats them as the basis for sequenced capability building.
Instead of pursuing premature autonomy, Kenya has adopted a phased
approach: securing negotiated access to frontier systems through a
partnership with Cassava Technologies, strengthening regulatory authority
and expanding domestic capability incrementally in partnership with global
firms.54,55 The core strategy is to build sovereignty through sequencing – a
deliberate progression from access to capability to influence.
The most visible expression of this model is the landmark $1 billion
Microsoft–G42 initiative to develop a geothermal-powered data-centre
campus and a new Azure cloud region for East Africa.56 By anchoring
compute to its geothermal-energy advantage, Kenya converts a domestic
strength in energy into a key enabler for sovereign AI capacity. Strengthened
data protection, as well as policy signals reflecting the country’s
prioritisation of domestic training capacity and open-data curation, and co-
development models across health, agriculture and climate illustrate a
posture of directed, strategic dependence.57,58
Kenya manages its constraints through directed, strategic dependence, by
securing frontier access via long-term partnerships, retaining oversight of
data governance, compliance and procurement standards, and using
regulatory strengths to shape how foreign infrastructure operates
domestically.

45

--- PAGE 46 ---

Kenya’s pathway contrasts with Japan’s fallback model, the UAE’s frontier
proximity and France’s regulatory strength. It shows how an emerging
economy can expand agency not through immediate capability, but through
negotiation, sequencing and leveraging unique national assets. Kenya’s
example demonstrates that sovereignty is attainable even for states with
limited resources.
FRANCE: SOVEREIGNTY THROUGH PUBLIC -LED INFRASTRUCTURE AND
REGULATORY POWER
France’s approach to AI sovereignty reflects a long tradition of state-led
industrial strategy combined with regulatory authority, creating a model that
prioritises domestic compute, enforceable data governance and nuclear-
backed energy sovereignty. This combination enables the state to steer AI
development from a position of infrastructural and institutional strength
while remaining interconnected with global ecosystems.
What distinguishes France is the depth and coherence of its state-anchored
foundations. High-performance computing systems, from the upgraded
Jean Zay supercomputer to the forthcoming joint MGX, Bpifrance, Mistral
and NVIDIA AI campus near Paris (with a capacity of about 1.4 GW), anchor
frontier compute within French jurisdiction while maintaining interoperability
with global supply chains.59 Sovereign-cloud initiatives such as Bleu and the
SecNumCloud certification standard reinforce this control, ensuring that
sensitive data remain under national oversight and stewardship. France’s
open-data infrastructures (data.gouv.fr, Recherche Data Gouv) further
support research and innovation while enabling the state to steer data flows
with confidence grounded in strong enforcement of the General Data
Protection Regulation (GDPR) by its national data regulator, the National
Commission on Informatics and Liberty (CNIL). These measures together
give France meaningful leverage over how AI systems are built, governed
and deployed domestically.
Although France benefits from strong institutions and access to nuclear
energy, it operates within a highly globalised AI ecosystem and relies on
foreign semiconductor supply chains and multi-national cloud providers.
France manages these dependencies by maintaining open channels for
SOVEREIGNTY IN THE AGE OF AI: STRATEGIC CHOICES, STRUCTURAL DEPENDENCIES AND THE LONG GAME AHEAD
46

--- PAGE 47 ---

innovation while imposing conditions such as data protection and cloud
security. By combining domestic compute expansion with regulatory tools,
France turns interdependence into a source of leverage.
France’s strategy contrasts with acceleration-led models such as the UAE’s
or resilience-first approaches such as Japan’s. Unlike Kenya’s or Brazil’s
partnership-driven capacity building, France’s posture derives from long-
standing institutional strength, abundant low-carbon nuclear energy and
regulatory credibility. This combination enables France to shape global
norms where scale requires openness, while exercising control in domains
where domestic institutions confer durable leverage. France illustrates how a
state with robust governance capacity can convert regulatory power and
infrastructure investment into meaningful technological influence without
pursuing full-stack technological independence.
INDIA: SOVEREIGNTY THROUGH SCALE, DIGITAL PUBLIC
INFRASTRUCTURE AND L AYERED CONTROL
India’s AI-sovereignty model leverages its population’s scale, its domestic
talent reservoir and state-backed digital public infrastructure (DPI) to forge a
distinctive model of AI capability. Through the IndiaAI Mission and the
broader India Stack, the government asserts strategic control over data,
digital identity and foundational digital services, while partnering with
domestic and international firms to bridge gaps in compute,
semiconductors and energy reliability. This produces a layered sovereignty
posture: control where the state has strong institutional capacity (data
governance, standards, India Stack and regulatory norms), steering where it
can direct investments and innovation (compute, model development and
public-sector applications) and managed dependence where structural
constraints remain (chips, energy and frontier-scale compute).
What distinguishes India is the depth of its DPI, which gives the state
unparalleled leverage over identity, payments, data sharing and digital
public-service delivery. Targeted industrial strategy complements these
foundations. The India Semiconductor Mission, with more than $10 billion
committed to catalyse domestic fabrication, assembly and design,
exemplifies this effort to transition from taker-dependence to maker-
SOVEREIGNTY IN THE AGE OF AI: STRATEGIC CHOICES, STRUCTURAL DEPENDENCIES AND THE LONG GAME AHEAD
47

--- PAGE 48 ---

dependence in the compute supply chain.60 India’s growing ecosystem of
sovereign-relevant models (BharatGPT, Sarvam-1 and Sarvam M), its
prioritisation of vernacular-language models, public-service use cases and
large-scale multimodal systems in policy, and its role in global governance
forums (the Global Partnership on Artificial Intelligence, G20 and the AI
Action Summit) further demonstrate how it converts scale, data and
institutional coherence into strategic leverage. Co-investment arrangements
with AWS, Microsoft, AMD and others expand national training capacity
while reinforcing India’s ability to adapt foreign technology rapidly to local
needs.
India manages its constraints in semiconductor fabrication, energy reliability
and frontier compute through structured partnerships such as co-
investment in cloud and compute infrastructure, joint model development
and localisation requirements. Regulatory tools covering data protection,
accountability and standards provide the state with additional leverage to
shape how foreign technology providers operate in India.
India’s pathway differs from regulation-centred approaches such as in
France and from Kenya’s sequenced model of capacity-building through
negotiated dependence. Instead, India benefits from a unifying national
digital architecture that few economies can replicate, providing a common
architecture across a large and diverse federal system. Its approach shows
how a large federal democracy can expand agency by governing key levers
of data, identity and digital infrastructure while leveraging partnerships to fill
capability gaps.
Rather than seeking full control across the AI stack, India uses scale, market
depth and state-coordinated DPI to generate strategic leverage. This
layered posture constitutes a sovereignty model rooted in population scale,
institutional coordination and deliberate prioritisation rather than
technological self-sufficiency.

BRAZIL: SOVEREIGNTY THROUGH REGULATORY STRENGTH AND
STATE-GUIDED CO-CREATION
Brazil’s AI-sovereignty strategy is shaped by its position as Latin America’s
largest digital, energy and industrial market. Its approach is one of strategic
hybridisation, combining a state-guided model of ecosystem co-creation
with regulatory authority and a clean and abundant energy matrix to build
domestic capability while remaining open to global partnerships. Brazil is
anchoring key elements of the AI stack, from data governance to energy
security and emerging compute infrastructure, while using public policy to
steer both domestic actors and foreign investors towards national priorities.
Brazil’s capability-building model is rooted in co-creation rather than
isolation. Public institutions, universities and domestic firms are developing
Portuguese-language and regionally aligned models such as SoberanIA,
Amazônia 360 and GovBERT-BR. These initiatives are supported by
significant public R&D commitments (approximately $4 billion under the AI
Plan 2024–2028), and increasing international cooperation, including the
China–Brazil joint AI lab.61 Brazil also leverages its regulatory power and
energy sovereignty to attract hyperscale investments.
While Brazil depends on foreign providers for cloud services, advanced
chips and foundation models, it manages these dependencies through
regulatory strength and investment conditionalities. Major commitments
including Microsoft’s $2.7 billion commitment, AWS’s $1.8 billion expansion
and Scala’s 4.75 GW AI City all follow reinvestment, localisation and
compliance requirements that ensure global compute capability is physically
and economically anchored on Brazilian soil.62,63,64 This combination of
enforcement capability and infrastructural advantage allows Brazil to attract
and condition global capability while building local industry.
Brazil’s posture differs from India’s DPI-anchored model of layered control,
the UAE’s frontier acceleration strategy driven by capital and global
partnerships, and Japan’s resilience-first approach centred on fallback
capacity. Its distinctiveness lies in its combination of regulatory leverage,
supported by a favourable energy base and large internal market, which
together allow it to shape how foreign capability enters and operates
SOVEREIGNTY IN THE AGE OF AI: STRATEGIC CHOICES, STRUCTURAL DEPENDENCIES AND THE LONG GAME AHEAD
49

--- PAGE 50 ---

domestically. This configuration enables Brazil to embed foreign investment
within national safeguards and convert dependence into domestic
innovation and capability building, demonstrating how large emerging
economies can expand agency without pursuing full-stack autonomy.

The following recommendations set out practical actions that decision-
makers can take to exercise sovereignty in the age of AI. They show how
accelerating AI diffusion across sectors strengthens domestic
competitiveness and reduces single-point dependence, how aggregated
demand and pooled infrastructure can secure more predictable access to
frontier capacity, and how targeted investments in data governance, talent,
energy and assurance institutions can anchor long-term capability.
Each lever represents a core trade-off between openness and control,
speed and stability, and access and autonomy. Taken together, they shape
how countries position themselves within the global AI ecosystem, ensuring
external capabilities reinforce national priorities rather than constrain them.
This provides a pathway for countries to remain connected to frontier
innovation while developing the institutional, technical and market
foundations required for resilience and sustained competitiveness.
Secure Access to Frontier AI Models and Compute
Frontier AI models and large-scale compute are becoming essential
infrastructure for national competitiveness in the new AI-enabled economy.
The strategic challenge for governments is not to own these systems
outright, but to secure reliable, predictable and governable access to these
capabilities. Each country must make deliberate choices about how much
compute it requires, which function can rely on remote or foreign
infrastructure, and which require domestic hosting to ensure resilience,
continuity and security in the event of disruption to global compute access
or frontier model capabilities. The same is true for models. Policymakers
should identify which use cases can rely on globally available frontier
systems and those that demand higher levels of control, auditability or
security where options such as customised open-weight models or secure
domestic deployments offered by industry may be more appropriate.
Policy Levers for Expanding
Agency in the Age of AI
07
SOVEREIGNTY IN THE AGE OF AI: STRATEGIC CHOICES, STRUCTURAL DEPENDENCIES AND THE LONG GAME AHEAD
51

--- PAGE 52 ---

• Develop a national strategy that defines frontier model and compute
requirements, access pathways and long-term needs. Building
domestic AI infrastructure requires coordination among various
government functions, from planning and grid management to
implementation. Governments should develop a clear, cross-government
strategy, led from the prime minister’s or president’s office, that sets out
sector-specific compute and model requirements, identifies which
workloads must be sovereign and which can be external, and defines
expectations around security, availability and resilience. Central
coordination is essential to align planning, energy, procurement and
international negotiations.
• Build sufficient domestic compute for deployment and inference.
Governments should concentrate their resources and efforts on securing
domestic inference (the ability to run trained AI models and generate real-
time outputs) capacity, rather than frontier training. Ensuring local
availability of national GPU clusters, sovereign cloud regions or high-
availability inference infrastructure operated under domestic governance
enables AI systems to be deployed reliably across public services. This
domestic capacity underpins continuity in critical services such as health
care, justice, border management and national security during global
outages, export-control disputes or vendor policy shifts.
• Negotiate multi-year sovereign access agreements that secure
predictable, high-priority access to frontier capability. Governments
should establish structured, multi-year access agreements with leading
international frontier AI firms to guarantee predictable access to frontier
AI capabilities. These agreements should include minimum compute
allocations for priority sectors, stable long-term pricing, non-interruption
clauses, emergency access provisions and audit rights, reducing
exposure to external supply shocks while strengthening bargaining
power.
• Form regional bargaining blocs to negotiate frontier access
collectively. Pooling demand across neighbouring or allied states allows
governments to negotiate lower prices, guaranteed capacity slices and
shared access pools, including coordinated training runs for regional
SOVEREIGNTY IN THE AGE OF AI: STRATEGIC CHOICES, STRUCTURAL DEPENDENCIES AND THE LONG GAME AHEAD
52

--- PAGE 53 ---

open-weight models. These kinds of consortia further reduce
dependence on any single provider or jurisdiction, and potentially
increase resilience to geopolitical or climate shocks.
Accelerate AI Adoption and Diffusion Across Sectors
Developing or possessing large-scale frontier AI models does not, by itself,
create economic or strategic value. Sovereignty is strengthened when AI
becomes a widely diffused capability, used by firms, public institutions and
citizens to increase productivity, improve services and enable new forms of
innovation. For most countries, this means that their focus should be
oriented towards accelerating the creation and deployment of AI
applications across the economy and ensuring that labour, capital and
institutions can absorb and adapt to these gains. This requires governments
to focus simultaneously on use and absorption: supporting the development
of applications that can scale across sectors and creating the economic
conditions that allow AI-driven productivity to translate into new firms,
industries and higher living standards rather than displacement or
concentration alone.
• Make AI-driven transformation an explicit pillar of economic strategy.
Governments should embed AI adoption into national growth, industrial
and sector strategies, with clear goals for how AI will modernise
manufacturing, health care, finance, agriculture and public services. This
also requires aligning regulatory, skills and investment policies to enable
firms to adopt AI at scale and to support the creation of new industries
that emerge from AI-driven innovation. By taking this approach,
governments can accelerate economic renewal, capture higher-value
segments of global supply chains and secure long-term national
prosperity.
• Treat national data sets as strategic assets to accelerate adoption.
Governments should develop trusted national data institutions or shared
data spaces that curate high-quality, representative and machine-
readable data sets in priority domains such as health, agriculture, climate
and finance. These assets enable more accurate fine‑tuning and

application development, reduce dependence on foreign data sets that
may not reflect local contexts, including languages, and create reusable
building blocks for research and innovation.
• Design sector-specific, use-case-oriented regulatory frameworks
that enable innovation. Horizontal, one-size-fits-all AI regulations often
slow deployment in highly regulated fields such as health, energy,
manufacturing and finance. Instead, governments should adopt sectoral
frameworks that set clear guardrails around high-risk uses while enabling
experimentation and faster deployment in low-risk contexts.
Aggregate and Signal National Demand to Shape the
AI Market
Private investment, talent and infrastructure flow to places where demand is
credible, coordinated and sustained over time. When AI demand is
fragmented across ministries, agencies or regions, ecosystems struggle to
emerge: vendors face inconsistent requirements, solutions fail to scale and
startups lack predictable pathways to growth. Aggregating demand, within
government and where possible across regions, transforms small or uneven
markets into structured opportunities that attract investment, justify national
or regional AI infrastructure and create meaningful leverage in negotiating
frontier access. Clear demand signals enable governments to influence
vendor behaviour, set interoperability expectations and crowd in private
capital towards national priorities. In a global environment where every
country is competing for frontier access and investment, demonstrating
coordinated domestic demand is often the decisive factor in attracting
hyperscalers, investors and partners.
• Publish multi-year AI roadmaps and national compute demand
forecasts. Governments should produce and update annual forecasts of
national compute demand over one, three and five-year horizons,
covering both public sector and anticipated private-sector use. These
roadmaps should indicate which proportions of demand require

54

--- PAGE 55 ---

sovereign capacity and which can be met through external providers,
reducing uncertainty for investors and enabling coherent planning across
ministries.
• Strengthen scale-up finance and investment pathways for AI-enabled
firms. Domestic AI ecosystems require access to growth capital to scale.
Governments should review capital-market rules, institutional-investor
mandates and development-finance instruments to ensure pension
funds, insurers, sovereign-wealth funds and public banks can invest in
growth equity and venture funds supporting AI-driven companies.
• Use targeted incentives, co-investment guarantees and pooled
procurement to de-risk early deployment. In sectors where public value
is high but commercial returns are uncertain, governments can deploy
subsidies, co-investment guarantees or minimum-use agreements to
anchor early demand. Pooling procurement across public-sector
organisations further reduces risk for suppliers, delivers better value for
money and ensures products are developed in line with national needs
rather than fragmented local requirements.
Treat Interoperability as a Core Component of
Sovereignty
As governments invest in new AI infrastructure, systems and services,
interoperability must be treated as a sovereign capability and not a technical
afterthought. In a rapidly evolving technological landscape, no state can
predict which models, platforms or vendors will dominate in the future.
Without interoperability, early architecture and procurement choices can
hard-wire long-term dependencies that become difficult and costly to
unwind. By contrast, interoperability underpins strategic autonomy by
ensuring that public systems can switch providers, combine models and
integrate new capabilities without wholesale rebuilds. It allows governments
to benefit from global innovation while retaining the freedom to reconfigure
their AI stack over time. This is especially important in an environment where
frontier capabilities are concentrated, and vendor incentives may diverge
SOVEREIGNTY IN THE AGE OF AI: STRATEGIC CHOICES, STRUCTURAL DEPENDENCIES AND THE LONG GAME AHEAD
55

--- PAGE 56 ---

from public priorities. Governments should therefore focus on modular
architectures, open standards and clear interoperability requirements across
all major AI systems and services.
• Define and enforce a national AI systems architecture based on
modularity and open standards. Governments should establish clear
architecture principles for all new public-sector AI systems, including
common data formats, open APIs and modular components. A dedicated
architecture function can coordinate standards across ministries, prevent
siloed development and ensure systems remain composable as
technology evolves.
• Use public procurement to make interoperability the default. Public-
procurement rules should explicitly favour AI-enabled systems that
demonstrate interoperability across providers, clouds and orchestration
frameworks. Contracts for major AI systems should require open
interfaces, multi‑cloud compatibility, and full portability of data and
models in widely used formats, ensuring workloads can migrate without
prohibitive switching costs or loss of functionality.
• Embed interoperability obligations into regulation and oversight.
Regulators should make interoperability a baseline expectation in sectoral
and cross-sector AI frameworks rather than an optional feature. This
includes mandating switching rights, disclosure of interface specifications
and ongoing compatibility with alternative providers. These obligations
should be paired with structured knowledge transfer such as embedded
engineering support, secondments and training so that public institutions
can maintain and adapt systems independently over time.
Build and Scale Smaller, Efficient and Contextually
Relevant Models
Frontier-scale models are costly, compute-intensive, linguistically narrow
and often misaligned with local contexts. For most countries, training such
models is neither necessary nor feasible. Strategic value instead lies in
smaller, efficient and adaptable models that can be tailored to national
languages, regulatory environments and priority sectors such as health,
SOVEREIGNTY IN THE AGE OF AI: STRATEGIC CHOICES, STRUCTURAL DEPENDENCIES AND THE LONG GAME AHEAD
56

--- PAGE 57 ---

finance, energy and science. As open-weight models rapidly narrow the
performance gap with closed frontier systems, these approaches offer
governments more cost-effective, governable and contextually aligned
options for deploying AI at scale. By focusing on model adaptation rather
than model ownership, countries can strengthen agency without entering
the frontier model race. Fine-tuned open-weight models and small language
models can deliver reliable public-sector performance, keep sensitive data
within national governance frameworks and support sector-specific
innovation. Used alongside selective access to frontier systems, they enable
governments to deploy AI where it matters most while retaining control over
data, risk and operational continuity.
• Invest in fine-tuning open-weight foundation models for national
languages, domains and regulatory requirements. Rather than building
models from scratch, governments should support the fine-tuning of
existing open-weight models on nationally relevant data sets – for
example, for linguistic alignment or domain-specific use in health care,
agriculture or public administration. As demonstrated by Japan’s Fugaku
LLM, among other similar emerging efforts, these models can become
sovereign assets that are culturally aligned, contextually relevant and
capable of efficient deployment.
• Develop regional model consortia for shared linguistic and cultural
contexts. Countries with overlapping languages or use cases can co-
develop open-weight models, similar to the Southeast Asian Languages
in One Network (SEA-LION) initiative to share costs, expand data set
diversity and expand applicability across borders.65 Regional model
alliances would enable smaller states to access systems they cannot
develop on their own while strengthening cross-border innovation
ecosystems.
• Adopt hybrid model architectures that combine local and frontier
capability. Hybrid designs allow governments to combine the low-cost,
locally governed capabilities of small models for sensitive or routine tasks
with the specialised strengths of frontier systems for complex reasoning
or multimodal workloads. This hybrid approach can reduce operational
SOVEREIGNTY IN THE AGE OF AI: STRATEGIC CHOICES, STRUCTURAL DEPENDENCIES AND THE LONG GAME AHEAD
57

--- PAGE 58 ---

costs and exposure to external policy shifts or outages while preserving
access to state-of-the-art performance where required.66 Governments
can incentivise hybrid pilots for high-impact public services.
• Establish domain-specific data trusts and national data libraries under
clear governance frameworks. Instead of negotiating training-data
access on an ad-hoc basis, governments can create data trusts that
securely pool anonymised data sets for model fine-tuning and evaluation.
These can be sector-specific, as in education or health care, or as TBI
has previously set out, they can be national endeavours that support
private–public collaboration through Data Biome partnerships that enable
model development aligned with national priorities.67,68,69
Invest in Talent and State Capacity
Sovereignty is rooted not only in technical capability, but in human and
institutional capacity. A country’s ability to harness AI's potential will
ultimately depend on the capacity of its people and institutions to
understand, deploy and govern it. Access to models or compute is
insufficient without a workforce that can use AI productively and public
institutions that can evaluate risks, procure systems and enforce rules with
confidence. Governments must act on two fronts. First, they need to reskill
and upskill the existing workforce, so AI adoption translates into productivity
gains rather than displacement or concentration. Second, they must attract,
develop and retain world-leading technical talent while embedding that
expertise within the state itself. Without this internal capacity, governments
remain dependent on external actors for interpretation, implementation and
oversight, regardless of how much infrastructure they access. By
strengthening talent at every level, governments can create the conditions
necessary for innovation, resilience and broad-based economic gains.
• Accelerate national reskilling and upskilling for an AI-enabled
economy. Governments should launch large-scale national programmes
to build AI literacy and practical skills across sectors, from manufacturing
and agriculture to health care and public administration. This includes
SOVEREIGNTY IN THE AGE OF AI: STRATEGIC CHOICES, STRUCTURAL DEPENDENCIES AND THE LONG GAME AHEAD
58

--- PAGE 59 ---

modular training pathways, sector-specific curricula developed with
industry, and incentives that encourage firms and workers to adopt AI
tools in everyday workflows.
• Reform universities and research institutions to compete for AI talent.
Universities must be equipped to support a modern innovation economy
rather than reproduce rigid academic hierarchies. Governments should
modernise governance and incentives, enable competitive remuneration,
and create flexible career paths that allow movement between academia,
industry and government, helping to retain talent and accelerate
knowledge transfer.
• Build deep public-sector technical capacity to govern AI credibly.
States should raise baseline AI literacy across the civil service, including
senior leaders, policymakers, technical teams and frontline officials,
through mandatory training and continuous learning programmes. At the
same time, governments should establish dedicated technical career
tracks with competitive pay, clear progression and rotation opportunities,
complemented by fellowships and secondments that embed expertise
within core public institutions.
Align AI Infrastructure with Sustainable Energy
Planning
The availability, reliability and cost of electricity are emerging as critical
bottlenecks on a country’s ability to deploy and scale AI. As AI adoption
accelerates, AI workloads will place growing pressure on national grids and
long-term energy systems. Because energy infrastructure is shaped by
structural constraints and long time horizons, most countries cannot expand
supply at the speed or scale required for compute-intensive AI. Sovereignty
therefore depends less on building more energy than on aligning AI
infrastructure with the energy systems countries can reliably expand and
sustain. Countries that fail to integrate AI needs into their energy planning
risk higher operational costs, grid instability, increased reliance on imported
power and, ultimately, an inability to host sufficient compute domestically. By
contrast, countries that plan proactively, co-locating compute with reliable,
low-carbon energy and integrating AI demand into grid strategy, can attract
SOVEREIGNTY IN THE AGE OF AI: STRATEGIC CHOICES, STRUCTURAL DEPENDENCIES AND THE LONG GAME AHEAD
59

--- PAGE 60 ---

investment, negotiate from a position of strength with hyperscalers and
ensure that critical digital services remain resilient. In all cases, future-
oriented energy planning is fundamental to sustaining national
competitiveness in an AI-driven world.
• Steer AI infrastructure towards energy-secure, low-carbon regions.
Governments can designate AI energy zones near hydro, geothermal,
nuclear or major solar corridors, and use targeted incentives such as
concessional finance, long-term power-purchase agreements (PPAs) and
expedited permitting to attract compute to grid-stable regions. This
approach reflects practices seen in France’s nuclear-enabled AI campus,
Kenya’s geothermal-backed cloud deployments and Brazil’s hydro-
powered data-centre ecosystem.
• Integrate AI demand forecasting into national grid and infrastructure
planning. Ministries of ICT and energy should jointly model AI workloads
and incorporate them into transmission, storage, cooling and substation
planning. Aligning grid upgrades with projected compute growth reduces
the risk of localised stress, prevents crowding out of households or SMEs,
mitigates the risk of local blackouts, and ensures AI expansion matches
real energy availability and future supply.
• Adopt green-compute standards and transparent energy reporting.
Governments should introduce standards tied to efficiency, utilisation and
emissions, such as waste-heat recovery, low-carbon PPA requirements
and reporting on energy use, emissions intensity and environmental-
mitigation measures, for all significant AI infrastructure projects. These
measures strengthen accountability, push vendors towards energy-
efficient model and infrastructure designs, reduce environmental impact,
and ensure that the expansion of AI infrastructure aligns with national
climate targets and long-term energy resilience.

Building resilience in the age of AI is less about controlling a single
technology than developing the capacity to adapt as technologies evolve. AI
will continue to advance faster than policy cycles, and this pace of change
means sovereignty cannot be treated as an end state. It is an ongoing
practice bringing investment, governance, diplomacy and public purpose
into coherence so that states can shape innovation rather than merely
absorb it.
There is no single ideal sovereign posture. What is feasible for large
industrial economies may be inefficient or unattainable for smaller or
energy-constrained states. Sovereignty instead emerges from how
governments sequence and align decisions across the AI stack: asserting
control where necessary, steering markets and standards where they have
leverage, and managing interdependence where capability gaps are
structural. Dependencies are inevitable, but they can be designed to be
diversified, reciprocal and capable of being renegotiated as national
priorities shift.
AI will continue to reconfigure rather than resolve geopolitical competition.
The same systems that promise inclusion, efficiency and economic growth
can also concentrate power in compute, energy and talent supply chains.
Smaller, efficient open-weight models may broaden participation, but the
upper layers of the AI stack will remain highly centralised. Navigating these
asymmetries will require governments to balance openness with security,
leverage with prudence and ambition with realism.
The measure of success for sovereignty in the age of AI will not be total self-
sufficiency, but strategic resilience. This is defined by the capacity of a
country to anticipate interdependence, learn rapidly from disruption and
steer innovation towards public value. Countries that treat AI as a central
pillar of state capability, deploy it widely across the economy and public

services, and build institutions capable of evaluating and governing it will be
best placed to preserve agency in a world of accelerating technological
change.
AI sovereignty, therefore, cannot be pursued in isolation; it must be built
through deliberate interdependence. States must ground their approach in
their comparative strengths and invest in the layers of the AI stack that
matter most for national priorities. The most competitive countries will be
those that adopt AI at scale, align their investments with clear strategic
intent, and negotiate their place in the global AI ecosystem from a position
of purpose and confidence. Maintaining sovereignty in the AI era will depend
on pragmatic decision-making, strategic prioritisation and continuous
negotiation across a rapidly evolving technological landscape.

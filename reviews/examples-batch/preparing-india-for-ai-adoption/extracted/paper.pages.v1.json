      "text": "Preparing India for AI Adoption:\nChallenges and Solutions\nHemant Adarkar1, Sridhar Ganapthy2\n1. Member, Advisory Council, Digital Empowerment Foundation and Senior Fellow,\nArtha Global\n2. Principal, Artha Global\nAbstract\nArtificial Intelligence (AI) is quickly changing economies and societies around the world. It is\nbeing used in healthcare, farming, education, and government to make systems more\nefficient, accurate, and scalable. India, with its young population, large amounts of data, and\ngrowing digital ecosystem, is well-placed to benefit from this AI revolution. But to unlock its\nfull potential, India must overcome several challenges—such as gaps in technology,\ninfrastructure, education, regulation, and ethics. This essay looks at the main obstacles to AI\nadoption in India and suggests practical solutions for building a sustainable and inclusive AI-\npowered future.\nIndia’s digital infrastructure has made significant progress in recent years through initiatives\nsuch as Digital India, the JAM Trinity (Jan Dhan, Aadhaar, Mobile), and the India Stack,\nwhich includes UPI, Aadhaar, and Data Exchanges (Ref 1 and 2). However, gaps remain,\nespecially in rural and semi-urban areas. AI requires strong digital connectivity, high-\nperformance computing, and reliable cloud services. Limited access to high-speed internet in\nremote regions restricts the rollout of AI-powered solutions such as telemedicine, smart\nfarming, and e-learning. Today, AI needs special hardware – such hardware has to be\nimported and is one of the major hinderance for AI becoming widespread in India.\nAI also depends heavily on data. While India generates vast amounts of it, much of the data is\nnot properly classified, fragmented, or siloed. Access to high-quality, annotated, and diverse\ndatasets is limited, and there are few interoperable platforms or standardized protocols in key\nsectors like health, agriculture, and education.\nTo address these challenges, India can focus on a few key solutions:\n Build public-private partnerships to expand digital infrastructure in underserved areas.\n Accelerate 5G rollout and leverage satellite internet initiatives like Starlink and\nBharatNet to achieve nationwide coverage.\n Establish regional AI infrastructure hubs with compute clusters and data centres\noutside major cities.\n Create national data exchanges with sector-specific platforms to enable sharing of\nanonymized, structured data.\n Expand open data initiatives with clear APIs and compliance rules.\n Develop data stewardship models that ensure ethical collection and use of data, with\nuser consent, privacy protections, and participatory governance.\n"

      "text": "India has several initiatives to establish data exchange platforms, including the\nupcoming National Data Platform (NDP) for a unified national data marketplace and the\noperational India Urban Data Exchange (IUDX), which facilitates secure data sharing for\nurban development. Another key initiative is the Agricultural Data Exchange (ADeX), a\nconsent-based platform for sharing agricultural data. These platforms are designed to promote\ndata-driven decision-making, innovation, and the development of data-based ecosystems\nacross various sectors. However, these efforts are seriously in need of public out reach\nprogrammes.\nIndia’s education system is not yet fully aligned with the needs of an AI-driven economy.\nWhile top institutes like the IITs and IISc are advancing AI research, most other institutions\nface challenges such as outdated curricula, a shortage of qualified faculty, and limited access\nto hands-on AI tools. As a result, there is a shortage of skilled AI professionals, particularly\nin Tier 2 and Tier 3 cities. Possible solutions include updating school and college curricula to\nintegrate AI, machine learning, and data science under the National Education Policy (NEP);\nintroducing faculty development programs through workshops, online courses, and industry-\nacademia partnerships; expanding accessible AI learning via government initiatives like\nSWAYAM and Skill India in collaboration with platforms such as Coursera, edX, and\nNPTEL; and creating AI-focused vocational training programs for ITI students, working\nprofessionals, and entrepreneurs.\nAs AI systems begin to influence decisions that directly affect people’s lives, it is essential to\nensure transparency, accountability, and fairness. At present, India does not have a\ncomprehensive AI policy or legal framework to deal with issues such as algorithmic bias,\nsurveillance, data protection, and liability in automated systems. There are several strategy\npapers – salient amongst them are from the Niti Aayog (Ref 3). and India AI mission (Ref 4).\nThe India AI mission has seven pillars: India AI Innovation centre for the deployment of\nindigenous LLMs, India AI Application Development Initiative for AI applications’\ndevelopment in critical sectors, AI Kosh Data Platform for creating datasets, models and\ntoolkits for innovation in AI platforms, India AI Compute Capacity for providing IT\ninfrastructure for AI, India AI Start-up Financing, India AI Future Skill for training\nmanpower and Safe and Trusted AI for creating adequate guardrails for development,\ndeployment and adoption of responsible AI.\nPossible solutions include formulating strong AI ethics guidelines in line with global\nstandards such as those from the OECD and UNESCO, with a focus on inclusivity, fairness,\nand transparency; setting up regulatory sandboxes where startups and companies can test AI\nsolutions under oversight; developing adaptive legal frameworks for emerging technologies\nthrough regular consultations and expert reviews; and creating a national AI ethics board to\noversee large-scale deployments and track their societal impact.\nIndia has over 22 official languages and hundreds of dialects, but most AI systems are trained\non English-focused datasets. This limits their ability to reflect the country’s rich linguistic\nand cultural diversity. If AI tools are not designed with inclusion in mind, they risk widening\nsocial inequalities, especially for marginalized communities whose specific needs are often\noverlooked. Possible solutions include strengthening the Bhashini initiative (Ref 4) to\ndevelop multilingual AI tools such as speech-to-text, machine translation, and natural\nlanguage processing across Indian languages; involving local communities in the design of\n"

      "text": "AI applications tailored to their contexts, whether in tribal healthcare, rural education, or\nurban sanitation; creating and open-sourcing region-specific datasets that capture diverse\nvoices, accents, and cultural contexts; and promoting greater participation of women and\nminority groups in AI development teams to reduce bias and support more equitable\nadoption.\nIndia lags behind global leaders in areas such as AI research output, patents, and startup\nfunding. While institutes like the IITs and IISc produce high-quality research, there is still a\nstrong need for closer collaboration between industry and academia, as well as better\npathways to turn research into commercial applications. Niti Aayog report says that India has\nless than 100 researchers out of a worldwide number of 25000.\nPossible solutions include setting up National AI Research Centres or Centres of Excellence\nacross regions, modelled on successful global institutions; supporting AI startups in sectors\nlike health tech, edtech, aggrotech, and fintech with seed funding, mentorship, and testing\nfacilities; building international collaborations with leading countries and organizations to\nshare knowledge and best practices; and boosting domestic startups by integrating their AI\nsolutions into public service delivery through platforms like the Government e-Marketplace\n(GeM). Integration of AI with Digital Public Infrastructure (DPI) will give rise to interesting\npossibilities – large amount of data availability for training and multi-lingual capabilities of\nAI can be extremely beneficial to DPI.  Public understanding of AI in India is still limited.\nMany people are unclear about what AI is, how it works, and what its impacts might be. This\nlack of awareness can lead to fear, misinformation, or resistance, especially when AI is\nintroduced in sensitive areas like healthcare or law enforcement.\nPossible solutions include running mass awareness campaigns through media, digital literacy\nprograms, and local-language content to explain AI’s benefits and limits; using community\nengagement models where citizens are involved and educated during pilot deployments;\ninvesting in explainable AI systems that can justify their decisions in simple, human-\nunderstandable terms to build trust; and creating citizen feedback mechanisms so users can\nreport errors, biases, or harms caused by AI systems, ensuring they improve over time.\nAs AI adoption increases, new concerns are emerging around environmental impact, misuse,\nand employment. Training large AI models requires significant energy, raising sustainability\nchallenges. AI can also be misused for harmful purposes such as deepfakes and\nmisinformation, while automation poses risks of job displacement. The biggest fear is a\nscenario where AI could lead to large scale unemployment (Ref 6). India needs to ensure that\nAI growth balances people, environment, and productivity.\nPossible solutions include promoting energy-efficient AI models and infrastructure powered\nby renewable energy; prioritizing AI projects that address social challenges in health, the\nenvironment, disaster management, and poverty reduction; launching reskilling and transition\nprograms for workers whose jobs may be affected by automation; and funding research on\nresponsible AI that emphasizes fairness, inclusivity, and sustainability.\n"

      "text": "Conclusion\nAI presents both a challenge and an opportunity for India. It has the potential to address some\nof the country’s most critical needs, such as better healthcare, quality education, sustainable\nfarming, and more efficient governance. However, these benefits will only be realized if\nadoption is proactive, inclusive, and ethical. By strengthening the infrastructure, improving\ndata systems, encouraging innovation, and building human skills, India can not only adopt AI\nbut also play a role in shaping its global future. What is needed is more than a policy—it is a\nnational effort that prepares every citizen, institution, and business for the era of intelligent\nmachines.\nReferences:\n1.

Executive  Summary
This  paper  presents  the  DPI–AI  Framework  as  a  practical  way  to  think  about  how  Artiﬁcial
Intelligence

(AI)

can

be

integrated

into

public

digital

systems

through

Digital

Public

Infrastructure

(DPI)
.

It

is

written

at

a

moment

when

AI

capabilities

are

advancing

rapidly,

while

many

governments

are

still

grappling

with

fragmented

systems,

legacy

architectures,

and

uneven

institutional

capacity.

Rather

than

proposing

AI

as

a

standalone

transformation,

the

paper

explores

how

existing

DPI

foundations

can

provide

structure

and

coherence

for

the

use

of

AI

in

the

public

sector.

Many  of  the  ideas  discussed  in  this  paper  are  not  new.  Modularity,  shared  services,  workﬂow
orchestration,

and

human

oversight

have

long

been

part

of

public

sector

digital

ambitions.

What

has

changed

is

the

maturity

and

accessibility

of

AI,

combined

with

the

attention

it

now

receives

from

political

leaders,

institutions,

and

the

market.

This

convergence

creates

pressure

to

adopt

AI

quickly,

often

before

there

is

clarity

on

how

it

should

interact

with

existing

public

systems.

The

paper

responds

to

this

gap

by

offering

a

framework

that

connects

current

AI

developments

with

established

DPI

principles

and

architectures.

The  DPI–AI  Framework  positions  AI  not  as  a  new  layer  within  DPI,  but  as  an  external  and
interoperable

set

of

capabilities

that

connect

to

DPI

through

shared

standards,

governance

mechanisms,

and

safeguards.

It

focuses

on

foundational

DPI

rails

such

as

digital

identity,

data

exchange,

and

payments.

These

foundations

allow

external

AI

systems

to

authenticate

users

and

institutions,

access

authorised

data,

and

operate

across

organisational

boundaries,

without

being

tightly

coupled

to

speciﬁc

applications

or

vendors.

At  the  core  of  the  framework  are  three  interrelated  elements  that  help  translate  this
integration

into

practice.

AI  Blocks  are  modular  units  of  AI  capability  that  can  be  invoked  as  callable  functions.  They
are

designed

to

perform

both

sector-speciﬁc

functions,

such

as

identity

veriﬁcation,

registry

creation,

credential

issuance,

or

decision

support,

and

foundational
,

bounded

tasks

such

as

classiﬁcation,

summarisation,

and

translation.

By

treating

AI

capabilities

as

reusable

building

blocks,

governments

can

adopt

and

evolve

AI

incrementally,

replace

models

over

time,

and

avoid

embedding

intelligence

directly

into

monolithic

systems.

DPI  Workﬂows  provide  the  orchestration  layer  that  coordinates  AI  Blocks  with  existing  DPI
systems,

policy

rules,

data

ﬂows,

and

human

oversight.

Workﬂows

deﬁne

how

identity

is

veriﬁed,

how

data

is

accessed

through

data

exchange

mechanisms,

and

how

AI

outputs

are

applied

within

public

processes.

They

make

it

possible

to

apply

intelligence

consistently

across

services  and  institutions,  while  maintaining  clarity  on  responsibility  and  decision-making
authority.

Public  Agents  are  AI-enabled  interfaces  that  interact  with  citizens  and  public  servants.  They
draw

on

AI

Blocks

through

DPI

Workﬂows,

while

relying

on

digital

identity

for

authentication,

data

exchange

for

authorised

access

to

information,

and

payment

systems

where

transactions

are

required.

This

separation

allows

experimentation

and

innovation

at

the

interface

level

without

compromising

the

integrity

or

governance

of

core

public

infrastructure.

Together,  these  elements  describe  how  intelligence  can  be  embedded  into  public  service
delivery

while

preserving

interoperability,

accountability,

inclusion,

and

sovereignty
.

The

framework

deliberately

avoids

prescribing

speciﬁc

technologies

or

models.

Instead,

it

offers

a

shared

mental

model

that

helps

governments,

development

partners,

and

ecosystem

actors

reason

about

where

AI

ﬁts

within

a

DPI-based

architecture.

The  paper  is  intended  for  digital  leaders  in  government,  development  partners,  donors,  and
practitioners

who

are

shaping

national

and

global

digital

agendas,

as

well

as

for

anyone

interested

in

societal

transformation,

poverty

alleviation,

and

developmental

impact

using

technology.

Its  aim  is  not  to  promote  AI  adoption  for  its  own  sake,  but  to  provide  a  clear  and  practical  way

with

the

foundational

towards

development

outcomes,

enabling

more

Introduction

In  a  pivotal  scene  from  the  1999  ﬁlm  The  Matrix,  Neo,  the  protagonist,  undergoes  an
instantaneous

transformation.

Seated

in

a

chair,

a

diskette

uploads

knowledge

directly

into

his

brain.

He

opens

his

eyes

and

declares:

"I

know

Kung

Fu"
.

For

a

generation

raised

on

the

cusp

of

the

internet

revolution,

this

cinematic

moment

symbolized

a

dream

of

frictionless

learning

and

limitless

upgradeability
.

Two  decades  later,  the  fantasy  remains  ﬁction.  But  we  are  indeed  entering  an  era  where
advanced

statistical

models,

particularly

Agentic

AI

(based

on

Large

and

Small

Language

Models
1
),

can

assist

in

generating

information,

summarizing

documents,

responding

to

user

input,

and

even

tailoring

services

at

scale.

These

systems,

however,

do

not

“understand,”

“reason,”

or

“think”

in

the

human

sense.

They

operate

by

predicting

patterns

in

data,

not

by

grasping

meaning

or

engaging

in

cognition.

There  is  no  need  for  a  new  mental  model  for  AI  in  government.  The  DPI  approach  is
already

set

up

to

integrate

AI,

as

long

as

we

carefully

consider

safeguards,

emphasizing

cross-sectoral,

governance,

and

procurement

implications

that

are

speciﬁc

to

AI.

In

other

words,

AI

does

not

require

a

separate

framework

but

rather

adjustments

within

the

existing

DPI

model.

From

this

perspective,

AI

naturally

ﬁts

as

just

another

modular

building

block

within

DPI,

reinforcing

the

principle

of

minimalism

and

reusability.

Why  act  now?
The  cost  of  inaction  is  already  visible.  Governments  that  postpone  building  AI-ready  digital
infrastructure

risk

deepening

dependency

on

proprietary

systems

and

locking

public

--- PAGE 7 ---

functions  into  closed  platform  models  whose  costs  increase  over  time.  Without  interoperable
and

publicly

governed

AI

capabilities,

ministries

duplicate

investments,

procurement

becomes

fragmented,

and

crisis

responses

slow

down.

The

greater

cost,

however,

is

institutional.

When

governments

lack

open

and

modular

infrastructure,

they

lose

the

ability

to

choose

their

own

digital

paths,

to

adapt

technology

to

local

contexts,

and

to

govern

it

on

their

own

terms.

Digital

sovereignty

is

not

achieved

through

isolation

but

through

capability
2
.

It

depends

on

building

the

competence

to

design,

reuse,

maintain,

and

evolve

shared

public

systems

independently.

Inaction

preserves

fragmentation

and

dependence.

For

example,

in

many

governments

a

signiﬁcant

share

of

IT

spending

is

devoted

to

maintaining

duplicate

systems

that

could

be

consolidated

through

interoperable

services,

with

or

without

the

use

of

AI.

Proactive

adoption

of

DPI

principles,

by

contrast,

builds

resilience,

reduces

long-term

costs,

and

strengthens

autonomy

through

reuse,

transparency,

and

national

capability.

Responsible

AI

adoption

must

also

consider

the

environmental

cost

of

training

and

operating

large

models,

promoting

efficiency

and

green

infrastructure.

For

Asia

and

the

Paciﬁc,

where

digitalization

remains

uneven,

inaction

risks

widening

the

digital

divide

and

increasing

dependency

on

global

proprietary

AI

systems.

Building

interoperable,

sovereign

AI

layers

ensures

that

countries

can

retain

control

over

data

and

technology

choices.

This  framework  does  not  assume  that  AI  should  be  prioritised  ahead  of  foundational  DPI
work.

In

many

contexts,

the

immediate

focus

remains

on

clean

registries,

reliable

APIs,

last-mile

connectivity,

and

minimal

institutional

capacity.

The

purpose

of

the

framework

is

to

show

how

intelligence

can

be

introduced

incrementally

once

these

foundations

exist,

without

forcing

a

wholesale

rebuild

of

public

systems.

As  these  technologies  evolve,  it  becomes  useful  to  reconsider  the  nature  of  government  itself.
At

its

foundation,

the

government

exists

to

deliver

essential

services

that

protect

rights,

meet

obligations,

and

support

people’s

everyday

needs.

To

do

this

reliably

and

at

scale,

governments

depend

on

shared

foundations

such

as

records,

laws,

and

regulations,

which

establish

authority,

deﬁne

eligibility

and

entitlements,

and

ensure

accountability.

From  this  perspective,  government  can  be  understood  not  only  as  a  set  of  institutions  or
service

channels,

but

also

as

an

underlying

infrastructure

made

up

of

reusable

and

rule-based

functions.

These

functions

operate

across

sectors

and

services,

drawing

on

multiple

sources

of

data

while

remaining

anchored

in

public

mandates

and

legal

frameworks.

Viewed

this

way,

governmental

functions

resemble

an

interoperable

system

that

can

combine

and

orchestrate

components

to

adapt

to

new

needs

and

contexts,

enabling

a

more

agile,

scalable,

and

people-centric

model.

What  is  Digital  Public  Infrastructure  (DPI)?
DPI
 3
 is  an  approach  to  digitalization  focused  on  creating  foundational,  digital  building  blocks
designed

for

the

public

beneﬁt.

This

approach

combines

open

technology

standards

with

robust

governance

frameworks

to

encourage

private

community

innovation

to

address

societal

scale

challenges

such

as

ﬁnancial

inclusion,

affordable

healthcare,

quality

education,

climate

change,

access

to

justice

and

beyond.

It’s

based

on

ﬁve

technology

architecture

principles:

1)

interoperability;

2)

minimalist,

reusable

building

blocks;

3)

Diverse,

inclusive

innovation

by

the

ecosystem;

4)

a

preference

for

remaining

federated

and

decentralised

(when

possible);

and

5)

security

&

privacy

by

design.

At  an  implementation  level,  this  approach  takes  shape  through  a  set  of  foundational,
interoperable

building

blocks
4
,

such

as

(but

not

limited

to)

identiﬁers

and

registries;

data

sharing;

AI/ML

models;

trust

infra;

discovery

and

fulﬁlment;

and

payments

that

enable

governments,

private

sector,

and

communities

to

interact

and

deliver

services

at

population

scale.

Like

roads

or

power

grids

in

the

physical

world,

DPI

provides

the

shared

rails

that

underpin

digital

inclusion,

economic

participation,

and

state

capability.

Countries
5

like

Argentina,

India,

Brazil,

Singapore

and

Estonia

have

used

DPI

to

expand

access

to

banking,

healthcare,

education,

and

welfare

systems,

often

leapfrogging

traditional

service

models.

In  many  countries,  the  reality  of  digital  transformation  includes  managing  existing  legacy
systems.

An

AI-ready

DPI

approach

does

not

require

wholesale

replacement

of

these

infrastructures,

there’s

not

enough

money

or

time

in

the

world

to

do

that.

Instead,

it

follows

a

"+1

approach",

enhancing

what

exists

through

interoperable

APIs

or

DPI

blocks

that

wrap

around

legacy

systems.

These

small,

modular

updates

allow

legacy

systems

to

actively

participate

in

the

DPI

ecosystem,

enabling

data

ﬂows,

orchestration,

(and

potential

AI

augmentation)

without

disrupting

core

operations.

It

ensures

interoperability,

data

portability,

and

gradual

modernization,

transforming

legacy

assets

into

programmable,

scalable

components

of

a

broader

digital

and

AI-ready

public

infrastructure.

What  is  Artiﬁcial  Intelligence  in  the  public  sector?
Artiﬁcial  Intelligence  (AI)  refers  to  computer  systems  that  learn  from  data  and  make
context-based

judgments

to

perform

tasks

such

as

understanding

language,

answering

questions,

executing

tasks,

recognizing

patterns,

solving

problems

or

generating

text

or

media.

Unlike

traditional

software

that

follows

ﬁxed

rules,

AI

systems

adapt

their

outputs

based

on

patterns

learned

during

training

and

ongoing

reinforcements.

examples  today  are  Large  Language  Models  ( LLM s),  which  are  powerful  models  trained  on
vast

amounts

of

data,

and

Small

Language

Models

(
SLM
s),

which

are

lighter

and

designed

to

run

on

smaller

devices

or

at

lower

cost.

In  government,  AI  can  help  public  institutions  work  better  by  making  services  faster,  analyzing
information

more

effectively,

and

offering

citizens

more

personalized

and

accessible

support,

while

ensuring

fairness

and

accountability.

Equally

important

are

fairness,

explainability,

and

human

oversight.

Public

sector

early

adoption

of

AI

often

begins

with

chatbots

and

virtual

assistants

that

respond

to

citizen

inquiries

and

has

scaled

to

code

or

policy

writing

to

enhance

gov

officials'

work.

Without

deeper

reforms

this

can

risk

becoming

"empty

shelf

AI",

tools

that

provide

information

but

fail

to

deliver

real

services.

To

avoid

this,

AI

tools

need

to

be

embedded

into

core

government

processes

so

that

it

contributes

to

measurable

improvements

in

outcomes.

Many  modern  AI  systems,  including  LLMs  and  SLMs,  are  trained  on  vast  datasets  collected
from

the

public

web

and

other

sources

where

ownership,

consent,

and

accuracy

are

not

always

clear.

As

these

systems

evolve,

they

increasingly

depend

on

access

to

new

types

of

data,

including

domain-speciﬁc,

institutional,

or

even

synthetic

datasets.

This

makes

data

provenance,

consent,

legitimacy,

and

stewardship

central

to

their

responsible

use

within

Digital

Public

Infrastructure.

In  the  DPI-AI  Framework,  this  does  not  imply  the  creation  of  a  new  data  layer,  but  rather  the
activation

of

the

existing

data

infrastructure

within

DPI

(Public

datasets,

registries,

and

consent

mechanisms)

as

the

foundation

that

allows

AI

systems

to

operate

safely

and

transparently.

Ensuring

that

the

origin,

governance,

and

permissible

use

of

data

are

clearly

deﬁned

is

essential

for

trust,

auditability,

and

compliance

with

national

safeguards.

Trained

AI

models,

or

“derived

tools,”

may

also

inherit

risks,

liabilities

and

biases

from

the

data

on

which

they

were

built.

This

reinforces

the

need

for

public

oversight,

ethical

certiﬁcation,

and

traceable

data-to-model

lineage.

Building  on  this  foundation,  the  next  layer  of  intelligence  involves  systems  that  can  use  this
data

responsibly

to

act

on

behalf

of

people

and

institutions.

These

systems

are

known

as

agents.

An

Agentic

AI

(Agent)

is

a

system

that

uses

AI,

such

as

an

LLM

or

SLM,

not

only

to

provide

information

but

also

to

take

action
.

Agents

and

assistants

can

connect

with

third-party

systems

to

perform

tasks,

such

as

searching

databases,

submitting

forms,

scheduling

appointments,

or

processing

transactions.

A

chatbot

or

AI

assistant

is

a

type

of

agent

that

communicates

with

people

in

natural

language,

making

it

easier

to

interact

with

public

services.

Building

on

this

idea,

a

Public

Agent

is

an

AI-powered

assistant

or

agent

integrated

into

government

systems.

Its

role

is

to

help

citizens

navigate

beneﬁts,

obligations,  while  supporting  governments  in  delivering  services  that  are  inclusive,
transparent,

and

efficient.

Training  language  models  and  data  governance
Every  model  learns  from  data
 6
.  Modern  AI  systems  are  not  born  intelligent;  they  are  trained
through

exposure

to

vast

collections

of

human-created

information

such

as

books,

code,

media,

and

public

records.

From

these

patterns,

models

learn

to

make

judgments,

predictions,

and

associations.

In

this

sense,

data

is

the

cognitive

layer

of

any

AI

system.

For

governments,

deciding

what

data

a

model

is

trained

on
7
,

who

governs

it,

and

how

it

can

be

reused

or

corrected

has

become

a

new

form

of

policy

design.

Governments  hold  a  unique  advantage  because  they  already  produce  and  maintain  large
volumes

of

high-quality

data

that

reﬂect

public

life.

These

include

registries,

legislation,

court

rulings,

service

records,

research

outputs,

and

cultural

archives.

Yet

much

of

this

information

remains

fragmented,

unstructured,

or

locked

within

systems

that

were

never

designed

for

its

data

to

be

accessed

for

learning.

The

ability

to

process,

structure,

and

govern

this

data

responsibly

will

determine

the

success

of

AI

in

the

public

sector.

A

government

cannot

train

a

trustworthy

model

on

unveriﬁed

or

ungoverned

data.

Open  and  governed  training  data
Governments  can  strengthen  trust  in  AI  by  developing  structured  repositories  of  high-quality
public

data

that

are

ethically

governed

and

accessible

for

research

and

innovation.

These

efforts

help

build

sovereign

cognitive

capacity,

allowing

models

to

reﬂect

national

laws,

languages,

and

social

contexts

rather

than

depend

entirely

on

external

or

opaque

sources.

In

practice,

this

does

not

imply

training

a

single,

general-purpose

model

on

vast

amounts

of

data,

but

often

supporting

many

smaller,

task-speciﬁc

models

that

are

trained

or

adapted

for

clearly

deﬁned

public

functions.

This  distinction  matters  for  scale.  Training  and  maintaining  large,  multi-purpose  models  can
require

levels

of

computational

infrastructure,

expertise,

and

operational

maturity

comparable

to

those

of

major

technology

companies.

By

contrast,

smaller

models

trained

on

well-scoped

datasets

can

be

more

feasible

for

governments

to

govern,

validate,

update,

and

deploy,

while

still

delivering

meaningful

public

value.

An

ecosystem

of

interoperable

models

can

also

evolve

over

time

without

creating

excessive

dependency

on

any

single

system

or

provider.

Privacy  and  data  protection  remain  central  to  this  approach
 8
.  Training  data  must  comply
with

existing

legal

safeguards

and

avoid

including

personal

or

sensitive

information

without

consent.

Once

data

is

embedded

in

a

trained

model,

it

can

be

difficult

to

remove,

correct,

or

fully

understand

how

speciﬁc

information

inﬂuences

outputs.

Governments

therefore

need

clear

processes

for

oversight,

privacy

preservation,

and

accountability

throughout

the

data

lifecycle,

including

an

explicit

recognition

that

not

all

associations

and

correlations

learned

by

AI

systems

are

predictable

or

controllable.

This  limited  controllability  cuts  both  ways.  AI  systems  may  surface  patterns  and  relationships
that

humans

would

not

easily

detect,

but

they

may

also

produce

unintended

or

harmful

inferences

when

trained

on

broad

or

poorly

governed

datasets.

These

risks

reinforce

the

importance

of

carefully

scoping

training

data,

aligning

models

to

speciﬁc

purposes,

and

maintaining

human

and

institutional

oversight.

Establishing  a  strong  foundation  for  public  data  governance  is  only  the  ﬁrst  step.  Once  data
is

responsibly

managed

and

made

interoperable,

governments

can

begin

to

build

intelligence

on

top

of

Digital

Public

Infrastructure.

The

DPI–AI

Framework

builds

on

this

foundation

by

proposing

an

approach

in

which

AI

operates

as

an

additional,

modular

layer

that

uses

and

extends

existing

DPI

capabilities.

In

this

model,

interoperability

enables

reuse

and

coordination

across

systems,

while

governance

and

sovereignty

ensure

that

AI

remains

aligned

with

public

mandates,

legal

frameworks,

and

national

context.

Bridging  DPI  and  AI
The  central  challenge  for  governments
 9
 today  is  not  to  recreate  intelligence,  but  to  design
infrastructure

that

connects

AI

capabilities

to

public

systems

safely

and

equitably.

This  paper  proposes  a  practical  path  forward:  building  on  top  of  existing  DPI  to  create  an
AI-ready

ecosystem.

In

this

approach,

DPI

remains

the

trusted

foundation

while

AI

operates

as

an

interoperable

layer

that

uses

this

foundation

to

generate

insights,

support

decisions,

and

enhance

public

service

delivery.

The  DPI-AI  Framework  deﬁnes  this  bridge  between  infrastructure  and  intelligence.  It
enables

AI

systems

to

plug

into

public

digital

rails

through

shared

standards,

safeguards,

and

transparent

governance.

By

doing

so,

it

extends

DPI’s

core

principles

of

openness,

inclusion,

and

accountability

into

the

domain

of

AI,

ensuring

that

rather  than  private  control.  The  DPI–AI  Framework  should  be  read  as  an  extension  of  DPI

DPI-AI  Framework
Imagine  a  farmer  in  Malawi  applying  for  a  climate  subsidy.  Today,  this  might  involve  ﬁlling  out  paper  forms,  waiting  weeks  for  manual  veriﬁcation,  and  risking  exclusion  if  records  are  incomplete.  With  an  AI-ready  DPI,  the  process  looks  very  different.   A  Public  Agent,  for  instance  a  chatbot  speaking  in  the  farmer’s  local  language,  guides  the  farmer  through  the  application.  The  process  is  structured  by  a  DPI  Workﬂow,  which  acts  like  the  recipe  for  delivering  the  subsidy.  The  workﬂow  deﬁnes  the  sequence  of  steps,  ensures  each  action  follows  policy,  and  coordinates  all  components  involved.  Within  this  recipe,  the  agent  invokes  AI  Blocks  as  ingredients:  one  block  checks  eligibility  against  government  registries,  another  translates  dialect  into  structured  digital  text,  and  yet  another  veriﬁes  satellite  imagery  of  crops.  If  the  workﬂow  encounters  a  problem,  for  example  the  farmer’s  ID  is  unclear,  it  routes  the  case  to  a  human  caseworker  agent  for  review.
 10
  This  scenario  captures  the  essence  of  the  DPI-AI  Framework:  a  design  approach  that  extends  public  sector  capability  by  embedding  modular  and  governable  intelligence  into  digital  public  infrastructure.
The  DPI-AI  Framework  is  an  architectural  design  approach  that  builds  on  the  foundations  of
DPI

by

adding

layers

of

intelligence

that

can

be

composed,

audited,

and

reused

across

services.

The  framework  incorporates  AI  of  different  sizes  and  purposes:  large  foundation  models,
smaller

task-speciﬁc

Small

Language

Models,

and

other

machine

learning

models

for

pattern

recognition.

By

focusing

on

transparent

and

purposeful

use,

it

ensures

that

AI

remains

aligned

with

public

values

and

policy

goals.

At  the  core  of  the  framework  are  three  key  concepts:  AI  Blocks ,  DPI  Workﬂows  and  Public
Agents
.

AI  Blocks  (or  tool),  a  callable  function  that  an  Agent  can  use  to  perform  a  speciﬁc  operation;
are

modular

components

that

expose

speciﬁc

capabilities

in

a

structured

way.

They

are

the

ingredients

that

can

be

combined

in

different

ways

depending

on

the

service

being

prepared.

These

capabilities

may

include

interpreting

policy

logic,

retrieving

data,

image

recognition,

generating

content,

translation,

assisting

classiﬁcation,

evaluating

eligibility,

or

offering

domain-speciﬁc

insights.

can

complexity  of  AI  adoption  by  separating  common  infrastructure  from  domain-speciﬁc
intelligence.

Finally,

AI

Blocks

are

not

only

governed

components

but

can

themselves

be

treated

as

Digital

Public

Goods
11

when

designed

with

open

standards,

transparent

governance,

and

policy

guardrails.

Equally,

existing

DPGs

can

adapt

into

AI

Blocks

when

augmented

with

callable

intelligence

that

plugs

directly

into

workﬂows.

DPI  Workﬂows  are  the  orchestration  layer  that  turns  AI  Blocks  into  usable  public  services.  If
the

blocks

are

ingredients,

the

workﬂow

is

the

recipe

that

determines

how

and

when

they

are

used.

A

workﬂow

deﬁnes

how

different

blocks,

data

sources,

and

agents

interact

to

complete

a

task.

It

structures

the

logic

of

delivery,

ensures

that

every

step

follows

policy,

and

makes

the

process

auditable

from

end

to

end.

A

DPI

Workﬂow

can

coordinate

actions

such

as

verifying

identity,

invoking

AI

Blocks,

accessing

registries,

and

triggering

entitlements.

It

provides

the

structure

that

ensures

AI

is

used

purposefully

and

safely

in

service

delivery.

Together,  AI  Blocks  and  DPI  Workﬂows  form  the  programmable  core  of  the  DPI-AI
Framework.

They

allow

governments

to

build

modular

intelligence

into

public

AI

systems

through

composable

and

governable

functions

that

align

with

the

principles

of

DPI.

Public  Agents  are  users  of  this  architecture  framework.  These  agents  are  the  frontline
operators

of

workﬂows

and

can

take

three

forms:

●  Human  agents  such  as  a  beneﬁts  officer  who  veriﬁes  exceptions  or  approves
payments.
 ●  Agentic  AI  such  as  an  assistant  that  answers  questions   or  executes  a  backend  system
that

automatically

checks

eligibility.
 ●  Hybrid  agents  such  as  an  immigration  officer  who  makes  ﬁnal  decisions  but  is
supported

by

AI

tools

that

pre-screen

documents

and

ﬂag

anomalies.

Agents  are  the  interface  between  systems  and  people.  Their  role  is  not  just  to  use  AI,  but  to
guide

how

AI

is

applied:

activating

workﬂows,

interpreting

intent,

resolving

exceptions,

and

ensuring

services

follow

institutional

rules

AI  Blocks:  Units  of  AI  that  act  like  callable  functions.
To  embed  intelligence  into  public  systems,  we  need  units  of  AI  that  act  like  callable  functions
or

tools
12
.

In

the

DPI-AI

Framework

these

units

are

AI

Blocks
.

These  blocks  follow  the  same  logic  as  DPI  components.  AI  Blocks  are  discrete,  auditable
modules

that

encapsulate

a

single

capability.

Each

one

can

be

invoked

by

a

Public

Agent

or

by

another

system,

much

like

a

function

call
.

Public

Agents

can

also

invoke

full

DPI

Workﬂows,

not

only

individual

Blocks.

This

creates

two

levels

of

action.

First,

an

agent

can

call

a

speciﬁc

function,

such

as

translation

or

eligibility

veriﬁcation.

Second,

the

agent

can

invoke

a

workﬂow

that

sequences

multiple

functions

into

a

complete

service.

AI  Blocks  are  deﬁned  by  the  function  they  expose,  the  interface  through  which  they  are
invoked,

and

the

governance

conditions

under

which

they

operate,

rather

than

by

the

internal

technologies

they

use.

In

practice,

many

AI

Blocks

will

be

hybrid

implementations

that

combine

rules-based

logic,

deterministic

checks,

data

integrations,

and

machine

learning

models.

Whether

or

not

a

block

uses

AI

internally

does

not

change

its

role

within

a

DPI

Workﬂow.

What

matters

is

how

it

can

be

composed,

audited,

replaced,

and

governed

as

part

of

a

public

system.

Think  in  terms  of  ingredients  and  recipes .  AI  Blocks  are  the  ingredients.  DPI  Workﬂows  are
the

recipes

that

combine

ingredients

with

policy

and

process

to

deliver

a

service.

Ingredients

remain

reusable

across

many

recipes.

Recipes

remain

transparent,

auditable,

and

easy

to

revise

as

rules

and

needs

evolve.

An  AI  Block  has  four  properties  that  mirror  DPI  principles:
1.  Minimalist .  One  clear  purpose  with  a  bounded  interface.  2.  Composable .  Designed  to  interoperate  with  other  Blocks  and  with  workﬂow  engines
through

open

APIs

and

common

data

formats.
 3.  Reusable .  Applicable  across  agencies,  sectors,  and  regions  without  rework.  4.  Governable .  Observable,  testable,  and  aligned  with  policy,  with  built  in  audit  trails
and

privacy

controls.

Interoperability  Example:  Model  Context  Protocol  (MCP)   As  AI  Blocks  evolve  into  reusable  and  modular  capabilities,  a  key  requirement  is  a  common  way  for  these  systems  to  exchange  context  and  interact  safely.  Emerging  open  standards  such  as  the  Model  Context  Protocol  (MCP)
 13
 illustrate  how  this  interoperability  can  be  achieved.  MCP  deﬁnes  a  lightweight  protocol  that  allows  AI  systems  to  access  external  data,  tools,  and  services  while  maintaining  contextual  integrity  and  auditability.   Within  the  DPI–AI  Framework,  mechanisms  inspired  by  MCP  could  enable  AI  Blocks  to  communicate  and  collaborate  through  shared  context  layers,  similar  to  how  APIs  enable  interaction  across  other  DPI  building  blocks.  Such  standards  are  not  part  of  DPI  workﬂows  themselves,  but  they  follow  the  same  architectural  principles  of  openness,  modularity,  and  federated  interoperability  that  underpin  digital  public  infrastructure.  Aligning  with  open  protocols  like  MCP  can  help  governments  ensure  that  AI  capabilities  remain  composable,  transparent,  and  portable  across  ecosystems.
Classifying  AI  Blocks:  Mapping  AI  Capabilities  into  a  DPI  Stack
AI  Blocks  can  be  classiﬁed  into  two  main  categories:  Foundational  and  Sector  Speciﬁc .
Foundational  AI  Blocks  are  general-purpose  capabilities  that  can  be  reused  across  many
sectors

and

services.

They

provide

the

baseline

tools,

the

multimodal

and

local

language

primitives

that

are

prerequisites

for

an

inclusive

and

AI-ready

nation.

Examples

include:

●  Translation  and  transliteration  into  local  languages  ●  Speech-to-text  and  text-to-speech
13
 Model  Context  Protocol  (MCP)  https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/getting-started/intro
16 / 42

--- PAGE 17 ---

●  Optical  character  recognition  ●  Text  summarisation  ●  Image  and  video  recognition
These  blocks  form  a  shared  public  kit  that  any  sector  can  use,  ensuring  inclusion  by  enabling
multimodal

and

local-language

access.

Sector  Speciﬁc  AI  Blocks  are  tailored  to  speciﬁc  sectors  or  workﬂows.  They  embed  policy
and

operational

logic

from

a

particular

domain

into

callable

functions

that

serve

public

mandates.

Examples

include:

●  Eligibility  veriﬁcation  for  social  protection  programs  ●  Identity  veriﬁcation  integrated  with  the  digital  ID  platform  ●  Vaccine  certiﬁcate  validation  in  health  services  ●  Clinical  decision  support  in  hospitals  ●  Personalized  tutoring  support  in  education
Foundational  and  Sector  Speciﬁc  blocks  are  complementary.  Foundational  blocks  provide  the
universal

primitives

that

ensure

accessibility

and

reuse,

while

Sector

Speciﬁc

blocks

extend

them

to

meet

the

needs

of

speciﬁc

programs

and

workﬂows.

For

instance,

a

speech-to-text

block

(foundational)

may

enable

voice

access,

while

a

grievance

ﬁling

block

(sector

speciﬁc)

interprets

the

speech

and

routes

it

into

a

social

protection

workﬂow.

AI  Blocks  themselves  can  also  be  considered  a  form  of  Digital  Public  Good  when  they  are
open,

reusable,

and

governed

with

policy

guardrails
,

just

as

existing

DPGs

such

as

MOSIP

or

DHIS2

can

adapt

into

callable

AI

Blocks

that

plug

directly

into

workﬂows.

This

reciprocity

makes

intelligence

a

core

building

block

of

digital

public

infrastructure,

alongside

identity,

payments,

and

data

exchange.

Just  as  DPI  created  shared  rails  for  identity  and  payments,  AI  Blocks  can  contribute  to  a
shared

layer

of

AI-Enabled

Public

Services

that

is

inclusive,

composable,

and

sovereign.

Their

true

value

emerges

when

Foundational

and

Sector

Speciﬁc

blocks

are

orchestrated

together

into

workﬂows

that

deliver

tangible

outcomes

for

citizens

with

transparency

and

accountability.

Safeguards  as  Callable  AI  Blocks   Most  DPI  safeguard  frameworks,  such  as  the  Universal  DPI  Safeguards  Framework
 14
,  set  out  principles  and  recommended  practices  to  ensure  digital  infrastructure  is  safe,  inclusive,
14
 The  Universal  DPI  Safeguards  Framework  https://www.dpi-safeguards.org/
17 / 42

--- PAGE 18 ---

accountable,  and  rights-respecting  throughout  its  life  cycle.  These  safeguards  span  risk  mitigation,  governance,  inclusion,  and  technical  robustness  across  stages  like  strategy,  design,  development,  deployment,  and  operations.   An  actionable  provocation  is  to  imagine  these  safeguards  not  only  as  policy  guidance,  but  as  callable  Foundational  AI  Blocks  within  DPI  ecosystems.  A  Safeguards  AI  Block  could  encapsulate  speciﬁc  checks,  validations,  and  compliance  tests  derived  from  the  framework’s  principles  and  associated  practices,  making  them  reusable  and  interoperable  across  agents  and  workﬂows  worldwide.   For  example,  such  an  AI  Block  might:  ●  Assess  and  ﬂag  potential  rights  and  safety  risks  in  a  dataset  or  model  output  before  use  in  a  public  service
●  Verify  that  AI  workﬂows  meet  deﬁned  principles  of  inclusion  and  non-discrimination  as  set  out  in  the  safeguards  framework
●  Generate  audit  records  or  compliance  reports  that  document  alignment  with  governance  expectations
●  Output  recommendations  or  constraints  when  running  in  a  DPI  Workﬂow’s  strategy,  design,  or  operations  phase
By  making  safeguard  logic  callable,  governments  and  ecosystem  actors  could  weave  shared  risk  mitigation  and  rights  protection  functions  directly  into  AI  workﬂows  and  Public  Agents.  This  doesn’t  centralize  control  or  enforce  one  model  on  the  world.  Instead,  it  turns  global  guidance  into  interoperable  infrastructure  that  supports  contextual  policy  choices,  local  governance,  and  consistent  operational  signals  about  safety  and  inclusion  across  implementations.   Such  a  callable  Safeguards  AI  Block  could  help  balance  interoperability  and  sovereignty  by  allowing  local  conﬁgurations  and  thresholds  while  preserving  a  common,  machine-processable  interpretation  of  globally  recognised  DPI  safeguard  principles.
DPI  Workﬂows:  The  Orchestration  Layer
While  AI  Blocks  provide  the  modular  capabilities,  what  turns  them  into  usable  public  services
is

how

they

are

orchestrated.

This

is

the

role

of

DPI

Workﬂows
,

which

function

as

structured,

auditable

recipes

for

service

delivery.

They

connect

Public

Agents,

AI

Blocks,

and

core

infrastructure

such

as

digital

identity,

payments,

and

data

exchange

into

coherent

ﬂows.

Each  workﬂow  deﬁnes  a  clear  sequence  of  steps,  along  with  the  data,  conditions,  and
safeguards

that

guide

how

a

service

is

delivered.

For

example,

a

social

protection

public

agent

may

invoke

a

workﬂow

that

veriﬁes

identity,

checks

eligibility

through

an

AI

Block,

and

18 / 42

--- PAGE 19 ---

initiates  a  payment  using  a  government  payment  rail.  These  actions  follow  a  formal  structure
that

ensures

transparency,

traceability,

and

alignment

with

public

policy.

Workﬂows  can  also  include  workﬂow-speciﬁc  Public  Agents  that  perform  specialized  tasks
inside

the

ﬂow.

Examples

include

a

subsidy-disbursement

Public

Agent

embedded

in

a

payment

workﬂow,

a

school-enrollment

Public

Agent

in

education,

or

a

vaccination-credential

Public

Agent

in

health.

These

workﬂow

Public

Agents

operate

as

contextual

AI

Blocks

that

plug

into

larger

orchestrations,

enabling

governments

to

target

complex

problems

with

precision

while

retaining

modularity.

Just  as  importantly,  DPI  Workﬂows  can  themselves  become  reusable  assets .  A  workﬂow
that

chains

together

identity

veriﬁcation,

eligibility

determination,

and

payments

is

not

only

a

service

but

also

a

sharable

recipe.

Published

in

open

repositories,

such

workﬂows

could

be

adapted

and

reused

by

other

governments

or

agencies,

much

like

open-source

code

or

containerized

applications.

Treating

workﬂows

as

templates

allows

countries

to

borrow

from

each

other’s

playbooks
,

install

them

with

minimal

effort,

and

adapt

them

to

local

policies

and

contexts.

DPI  Workﬂows  are  therefore  more  than  technical  connectors.  They  represent  the  logic  of
coordination,

the

structure

that

enables

diverse

components

such

as

Digital

Public

Goods,

AI

Blocks,

and

legacy

systems

to

operate

together

with

consistency

and

oversight.

This

modular

approach

makes

public

systems

more

resilient,

auditable,

and

adaptable

to

local

contexts.

Inclusion  is  a  central  outcome  of  workﬂows.  By  embedding  Foundational  AI  Blocks  like
voice-ﬁrst

conversational

ﬂows,

multilingual

translation,

and

accessibility

features

directly

into

orchestration,

workﬂows

allow

citizens

with

limited

literacy

or

connectivity

to

access

public

services

on

equal

terms.

Trust,

security,

privacy

and

safeguards

are

built

in

at

the

workﬂow

level,

ensuring

that

orchestrated

intelligence

operates

within

institutional

rules

and

protects

citizens

by

design.

Public  Agents:  AI-enabled  assistants  for  the  public  sector
Small  Language  Models  (SLM)  (or  Large  Language  Models  depending  on  scale,  budget  or
context),

optimized

for

efficiency

and

contextual

relevance,

can

be

deployed

within

ministries,

municipal

offices,

or

service

centers.

When

coupled

with

DPI,

they

power

the

creation

of

Public

Agents.

Public  Agents  are  AI-enabled  assistants  that  may  take  the  form  of  software-based  agents,
AI-assisted

public

servants,

or

hybrid

arrangements

combining

both.

They

interact

with

citizens,

officials,

or

service

providers

within

deﬁned

rights-based

boundaries,

and

activate

DPI

Workﬂows

that

orchestrate

the

use

of

AI

Blocks

to

complete

speciﬁc

tasks.

In

all

cases,

Public

Agents

are

not

autonomous

actors

but

accountable

extensions

of

government

capacity,

ensuring

that

interactions

remain

auditable

and

aligned

with

public

governance.

In  practice,  Public  Agents  use  the  language  and  reasoning  capabilities  of  SLMs  to  help
interpret

intent,

structure

requests,

and

guide

workﬂows.

Where

appropriate,

these

capabilities

may

support

human

decision-makers

rather

than

replace

them.

The

Public

Agent

coordinates

which

AI

Blocks

are

invoked

and

how

the

workﬂow

proceeds,

enabling

bounded

functions

such

as

guiding

an

enrolment,

validating

a

document,

or

initiating

a

transaction.

Public  Agents  can  support  tasks  such  as:
●  Act  as  on-demand  experts ,  embedded  in  messaging  platforms,  web  portals  or
mobile

apps.
 ●  Handle  citizen  queries  using  publicly  governed  AI  blocks  such  as  eligibility  veriﬁcation,
grievance

ﬁling,

or

identity

assistance.

22 / 42

--- PAGE 23 ---

●  Operate  in  low-resource  or  multilingual  environments ,  using  lightweight  language
models

adapted

with

local

data

and

civic

logic.

In  some  cases,  Public  Agents  may  also  be  specialized  for  a  single  function  within  a  workﬂow,
such

as

verifying

eligibility

against

registries

or

validating

submitted

documents.

These

remain

callable,

modular

units

aligned

with

DPI,

complementing

foundational

AI

Blocks

without

requiring

full

retraining.

As  these  modular  capabilities  mature,  there  is  a  natural  progression  toward  multi-agent
orchestration
15
.

This

refers

to

multiple

agents

collaborating

by

sharing

context,

coordinating

across

workﬂows,

and

dynamically

decomposing

tasks

that

a

single

agent

could

not

achieve

alone.

Such

architectures

introduce

new

requirements

for

trust,

interoperability,

and

accountability.

DPI

provides

the

shared

digital

rails

to

meet

these

requirements,

offering

common

protocols,

registries,

and

governance

frameworks

that

ensure

agents

and

workﬂows

operate

securely

and

transparently.

Building

trust

in

Public

Agents

requires

transparency

in

their

actions,

clear

consent

mechanisms,

and

cultural

and

linguistic

adaptation

to

local

contexts.

Architecture  Principles  and  Design  Patterns  of  the  DPI–AI
Framework

The  DPI–AI  Framework  builds  on  and  extends  the  DPI  Tech  Architecture  Principles
 16
 into  the
domain

of

AI-Enabled

Public

Services.

The

same

design

logics

that

allowed

digital

identity,

payments,

and

data

exchange

to

scale

inclusively

now

guide

the

creation

of

AI

Blocks,

DPI

Workﬂows,

and

Public

Agents.

Together,

these

elements

form

the

programmable

core

of

AI-ready

digital

public

infrastructure.

To

support

both

durable

governance

and

practical

implementation,

the

framework

distinguishes

between

Principles

and

Patterns
.

Together,

they

provide

a

foundation

for

governments

to

design,

govern,

and

evolve

AI-Enabled

Public

Services

that

are

open,

modular,

and

trustworthy.

Principles:  The  “Why”  —  Governance  and  Philosophy
Principles  deﬁne  the  enduring  foundations  of  the  DPI–AI  Framework.  They  express  the  values
and

governance

logics

that

guide

how

systems

should

be

designed

and

deployed,

regardless

of

technology

or

context.

These

are

the

non-negotiable

elements

that

ensure

AI-enabled

public

services

remain

sovereign,

inclusive,

and

accountable.

Principles

answer

the

“why”

behind

the

architecture:

why

we

prioritize

openness

over

control,

reuse

over

reinvention,

and

public

purpose

over

private

optimization.

1.  Interoperability  and  Portability  over  Lock-In:  AI  Blocks  and  DPI  Workﬂows,  should
be

(when

possible)

model-,

cloud-

and

vendor-agnostic.

They

should

operate

through

open

APIs

and

shared

protocols,

ensuring

portability

across

cloud

providers,

model

architectures,

and

hosting

environments.

This

prevents

dependency

on

a

single

vendor,

enables

hybrid

deployments,

and

safeguards

sovereign

control

over

national

digital

systems.
 2.  Minimalism:  Each  AI  Block,  DPI  Workﬂow,  or  Agent  should  have  a  single,  well-deﬁned
purpose

with

a

bounded

interface.

By

avoiding

over-speciﬁcation

and

monolithic

16
 CDPI  DPI  Tech  Architecture  Principles  https://docs.cdpi.dev/the-dpi-wiki/dpi-tech-architecture-principles
25 / 42

--- PAGE 26 ---

designs,  minimalism  keeps  intelligence  auditable,  reduces  complexity,  and  ensures
components

remain

reusable

and

evolvable

as

new

technologies

and

policies

emerge.
 3.  Inclusion  by  Design:  AI-Enabled  Public  Services  must  expand  access,  not  reinforce
exclusion.

Foundational

AI

Blocks

for

voice,

translation,

transcription,

image

recognition

and

accessibility

are

prerequisites.

Workﬂows

should

embed

voice-ﬁrst

and

multilingual

interaction,

and

Agents

should

be

designed

to

serve

citizens

with

low

literacy

or

connectivity.

Foundational

AI

Blocks

must

support

offline

operation

where

feasible,

with

local

caching

of

critical

functions

and

synchronization

when

connectivity

is

restored.
 4.  Sovereign  by  Design :  Sovereignty  is  not  just  about  where  data  is  stored,  but  about
maintaining

the

agency

and

capacity

to

shape

digital

futures

by

design
17
.

Countries

should

embed

local

policy

logic,

data

governance,

and

cultural

norms

into

AI

Blocks,

Workﬂows,

and

Public

Agents,

while

building

the

institutional

competence

to

make

strategic

choices

about

technology

dependencies.

Sovereignty

in

DPI-AI

means

retaining

control,

understanding

the

options

and

costs

of

changing

solution

or

supplier

to

avoid

a

lock-in,

and

ensuring

that

digital

systems

serve

national

priorities

while

enabling

informed

collaboration

with

global

ecosystems.
 5.  Security  and  Privacy  by  Design:  AI  Blocks,  Workﬂows,  and  Agents  should  all  emit
auditable

logs,

respect

consent,

and

preserve

rights.

Bias

detection,

explainability,

and

oversight

are

embedded

by

default,

ensuring

that

intelligence

strengthens

public

trust.
 6.  AI  as  an  Enabler,  Not  a  Replacement:  AI  systems  are  augmentative  tools.  They
support

tasks

such

as

classiﬁcation,

summarization,

executions

and

translation

within

DPI

domains,

they

execute

human

judgment

but

they

do

not

replace

institutional

accountability.

Their

role

is

functional

and

bounded,

not

autonomous.

Safeguards

and

Ethical

Oversight:

Every

AI

Block,

Workﬂow,

and

Agent

must

comply

with

ethical,

legal,

and

institutional

safeguards,

ensuring

transparency,

explainability,

and

auditability

in

all

decision-making

processes.

Patterns:  The  “How”  —  Technical  and  Operational  Application
Patterns  describe  how  the  principles  are  translated  into  practice.  They  capture  the
repeatable

methods

and

design

approaches

that

make

the

framework

real

in

implementation.

While

principles

remain

constant,

patterns

evolve

with

technology,

institutional

maturity,

and

local

context.

They

guide

the

“how”:

how

modular

systems

are

composed,

how

interoperability

is

achieved,

and

how

collaboration

between

public

and

private

actors

is

structured

to

align

with

shared

goals.

 Public  Digital  -  Our  view  on  digital  sovereignty  https://public.digital/pd-insights/blog/2025/07/our-view-on-digital-sovereignty
26 / 42

--- PAGE 27 ---

1.  Modularity :  AI  Blocks,  DPI  Workﬂows,  and  Public  Agents  should  be  composable  into
larger

systems

through

APIs

and

shared

speciﬁcations.

Agents

themselves

should

also

be

able

to

interoperate

and

combine

with

other

agents,

enabling

multi-agent

orchestration.

This

modularity

supports

incremental

upgrades,

cross-sector

reuse,

and

local

adaptation

without

requiring

full

infrastructure

overhauls.
 2.  Federated  by  Design:  DPI-AI  systems  should  avoid  centralization  when  possible.  AI
Blocks,

DPI

Workﬂows,

and

Public

Agents

must

be

designed

for

federated

deployment

across

multiple

government

agencies,

subnational

organizations,

and

ecosystem

actors.

Based

on

the

principle

of

modularity,

each

component

should

remain

independently

deployable

while

interoperating

through

shared

standards.

This

ensures

resilience,

distributed

control,

and

interoperability

without

creating

single

points

of

failure.
 3.  Efficiency  through  Reuse:  Foundational  AI  Blocks,  workﬂow  templates,  and  reusable
agent

skills

should

be

deployed

once

and

reused

across

sectors.

This

reduces

duplication,

accelerates

scaling,

and

creates

economies

of

scale,

particularly

for

resource-constrained

governments.
 4.  Structured  Public–Private  Collaboration:  Governments  set  the  guardrails
(speciﬁcations,

standards,

interfaces,

and

governance

protocols)

within

which

the

private

sector

and

civic

innovators

can

build.

This

applies

to

Blocks,

Workﬂows,

and

Agents

alike,

ensuring

innovation

is

aligned

with

public

purpose

while

leveraging

market

energy.
 5.  Regional  Alignment  and  Cross-Border  Integration :  Regional  digital  integration
should

be

built

on

interoperable,

federated

systems

that

enable

cross-border

collaboration

without

centralising

control.

By

aligning

standards,

governance

approaches,

and

technical

architectures,

countries

can

create

shared

digital

corridors

across

identity,

payments,

and

data

exchange

while

preserving

national

sovereignty.

Modular

and

interoperable

designs

support

responsible

scaling,

ﬁscal

sustainability,

and

the

gradual

emergence

of

AI-ready

regional

digital

ecosystems.
 6.  Workﬂow-Centric  Service  Delivery:  The  unit  of  delivery  in  the  DPI-AI  Framework  is
the

DPI

Workﬂow.

Seen  through  this  structure,  the  DPI–AI  Framework  reimagines  the  idea  of  the  digital  stack

From  Digital  Public  Goods  to  AI  Blocks:  Expanding
the

DPG

Ecosystem

Digital  Public  Goods
 20
 (DPGs)  have  catalyzed  the  growth  of  Digital  Public  Infrastructure  by
providing

open-source

software,

open

standards,

open

data,

open

AI

systems,

and

open

content

collections

that

adhere

to

privacy

and

other

applicable

laws

and

best

practices,

do

no

harm,

and

help

attain

the

Sustainable

Development

Goals

(SDGs).

In  the  context  of  AI-enhanced  governance,  we  propose  to  treat:  DPGs  as  Sector  Speciﬁc  AI
Blocks
,

supported

by

their

existing

APIs

and

microservices

architecture.

The

true

value

emerges

when

AI

Blocks

and

DPGs

are

orchestrated

through

DPI

Workﬂows

and

invoked

by

Public

Agents.

A

DPI

workﬂow

might

combine

identity

veriﬁcation,

eligibility

assessment,

payment

instruction,

and

notiﬁcation

into

a

single

auditable

pathway,

while

a

Public

Agent

interprets

citizen

intent

and

activates

the

right

sequence

of

functions.

By  reframing  DPGs  as  callable  infrastructure,  governments  gain  responsiveness  and
modularity.

AI

Blocks,

acting

as

tools

for

Public

Agents,

can

be

dynamically

invoked

through

workﬂows

without

retraining

or

redesign.

This

preserves

the

openness

and

public

ownership

of

DPGs

while

extending

their

utility

into

the

AI

layer

of

digital

infrastructure.

Sustaining

open-source

AI

Blocks

requires

clear

funding

models,

community

governance,

and

international

collaboration

through

open

repositories

like

the

Digital

Public

Goods

Alliance

Registry
21
.

DPGs  projects  as  AI  Blocks:  Tools  for  Public  Agents  To  illustrate  this  modular  shift,  we  can  treat  existing  DPGs  as  Sector  Speciﬁc  AI  Blocks ,   part  of  DPI  Workﬂows  or  invoked  by  Public  Agents.  Each  function  exposes  a  speciﬁc,  auditable  capability  that  can  be  composed  with  others  to  form  complete  services:
●  MOSIP  exposes enroll_identity() to  support  digital  ID  registration  guidance.  ●  OpenCRVS  becomes  register_birth(),  triggering  civil  registration  workﬂows.  ●  OpenSPP  offers  check_beneﬁt_eligibility() for  social  protection  assessments.  ●  OpenFn  exposes  instantiate_workﬂow(wf_id) to  allow  an  AI  agent  to  start  a  speciﬁc  DPI  workﬂow..  ●  Mifos  provides  get_credit_proﬁle() for  inclusive  ﬁnance  use  cases.  ●  Mojaloop  supports  transfer_funds() within  secure,  interoperable  payment  networks.

--- PAGE 30 ---

●  X-Road  offers  fetch_veriﬁed_record() to  retrieve  authenticated  public  data.  ●  Inji  or  Diia  act  as  credentialing  endpoints,  such  as  issue_credential() or  verify_identity() using  veriﬁable  credential  wallets.
Alongside  these,  Foundational  AI  Blocks  expose  intelligence  functions  in  the  same  callable  manner:  ●  classify_document() for  automated  document  review.  ●  summarize_case_ﬁle() for  grievance  handling.  ●  translate_local_language()  for  multilingual  service  delivery.  ●  detect_anomaly() for  fraud  or  error  prevention.
When  connected  through  DPI  Workﬂows ,  these  callable  functions  form  auditable  service  pathways.  For  example,  a  human  agent  assisting  a  citizen  can  invoke  verify_identity() via  MOSIP ,  check_beneﬁt_eligibility() via  OpenSPP ,  and  then  transfer_funds() through  Mojaloop ,  while  an  AI  Block  provides  a  plain-language  explanation  of  the  outcome.
This  approach  reframes  DPGs  and  AI  Blocks  as  interoperable,  callable  components  that  can
be

dynamically

assembled

by

Public

Agents

and

orchestrated

through

DPI

Workﬂows.

In

doing

so,

they

become

infrastructure-native

services:

discoverable,

composable,

and

adaptable

across

jurisdictions.

The  shift  also  presents  challenges.  Existing  DPG  projects  must  evolve  from  vertically
integrated

platforms

to

modular,

workﬂow-ready

functions,

requiring

new

design

and

business

models.

At

the

same

time,

this

opens

opportunities:

callable

infrastructure

can

embed

directly

into

governance

and

service

delivery,

and

new

funding

models

tied

to

usage

and

ecosystem

value

can

strengthen

sustainability

while

keeping

DPGs

open,

trusted,

and

globally

interoperable.

Challenges  Ahead:  Safeguards,  Procurement  &
Governance

The  modular  vision  is  powerful,  but  realizing  it  at  scale  depends  on  overcoming  key
institutional

and

ecosystem

barriers.

While

the

technological

landscape

for

AI

and

DPI

is

advancing

rapidly,

the

primary

bottlenecks

lie

not

in

capability

but

in

procurement,

governance,

and

operational

design.

The

DPI-AI

Framework

offers

a

pathway

to

embed

intelligence

into

digital

systems

through

modular,

rights-based

design,

but

scaling

this

vision

requires

addressing

deep

institutional

constraints.

Across  DPI  workﬂows  such  as  eligibility  determination,  consent  orchestration,  document
translation,

or

beneﬁts

targeting,

AI

Blocks

are

already

emerging

as

composable

building

blocks.

Yet

the

systems

that

support

them

remain

misaligned.

To

operationalize

and

scale

the

framework

responsibly,

governments

and

development

partners

must

align

their

strategies

with

universal

safeguards

for

human

rights,

equity,

and

transparency.

These

challenges

emerge

as

key

things

to

be

addressed

by

the

ecosystem:

1.  Outcome-Oriented,  Rights-Based  Procurement :  Procurement  frameworks  must
evolve

from

static

deliverables

to

outcome-driven

models

tailored

to

speciﬁc

public

functions

such

as
 translate  document,  predict  eligibility,  or  ﬂag  anomaly.  Safeguards
including

data

protection,

explainability,

and

accessibility

must

be

embedded

from

the

outset.

Agile

instruments

such

as

open

frameworks

and

milestone-based

contracting

can

help

match

the

pace

of

AI

innovation

while

preserving

accountability.

2.  Veriﬁcation  and  Certiﬁcation  of  AI  Blocks :  As  AI  Blocks  become  modular,  callable
components

reused

across

public

workﬂows,

ensuring

their

safety

and

integrity

becomes

a

critical

challenge.

Governments

may

increasingly

depend

on

third-party

foundational

and

sector-speciﬁc

AI

Blocks,

creating

risks

of

integrating

malicious

or

compromised

components

that

could

enable

identity

theft,

fraud,

impersonation,

or

other

harms

ampliﬁed

by

AI-driven

automation.

This  raises  unresolved  questions  about  veriﬁcation  and  certiﬁcation.  Unlike  traditional
software,

AI

Blocks

can

change

behaviour

over

time,

making

one-time

approval

insufficient.

Clear

responsibility

is

needed

for

who

validates

AI

Blocks,

against

what

criteria,

and

with

what

ongoing

oversight.

One

approach

is

continuous

certiﬁcation:

AI

Blocks

undergo

initial

approval

and

are

subject

to

ongoing

monitoring

of

performance,

bias

metrics,

and

security

vulnerabilities.

Certiﬁcation

authorities

can

revoke

approval

if

blocks

drift

below

acceptable

thresholds.

Whether

this

role

should

be

performed

by

governments,

independent

bodies,

or

ecosystem

actors

such

as

33 / 42

--- PAGE 34 ---

Digital  Public  Goods  Alliance  remains  open,  but  addressing  it  will  be  essential  to
maintain

security,

trust,

and

accountability

in

AI-enabled

public

infrastructure.

3.  Utility-Based  Pricing  and  Interoperable  Licensing :  Public  workﬂows  such  as  KYC  or
document

veriﬁcation

may

invoke

AI

functions

thousands

of

times

per

day.

Usage-based

pricing

tied

to

service

units,

rather

than

bundled

licenses,

can

reduce

vendor

dependence

and

improve

ﬁscal

planning.

Equitable

access

for

low-income

countries

requires

royalty-free

or

tiered

/

dynamic

pricing

aligned

with

open

norms.

4.  AI-Ready  Financing  from  Development  Banks :  Multilateral  development  banks  must
recognize

AI

as

a

core

layer

of

digital

public

infrastructure,

not

a

peripheral

add-on.

Financing

instruments

should

support

co-development,

conditional

disbursements

on

open

standards

adoption,

and

invest

in

national

capacity

for

auditing,

safeguards,

and

ethical

implementation.

5.  Institutional  and  Ecosystem  Capacity  Building :  Governments  must  invest  in
governance

capacity

to

design,

deploy,

and

adapt

AI-enabled

infrastructure.

This

includes

training

civil

servants,

creating

data

governance

units,

and

supporting

local

developers.

Capacity

must

extend

to

inclusion

practices

such

as

voice-ﬁrst

and

multilingual

interfaces

that

ensure

underserved

groups

are

reached.

6.  Monitoring  and  Evaluation :  The  absence  of  shared  metrics  and  evaluation
frameworks

makes

it

difficult

for

governments

to

benchmark

progress,

compare

approaches,

and

ensure

accountability

in

AI

deployment.

Greater

alignment

around

common

metrics,

speciﬁcations,

and

standards,

such

as

AI

management

systems

and

internationally

recognised

principles,

would

support

more

consistent

monitoring

and

oversight.

7.  Data  Governance  and  Digital  Sovereignty :  Data  is  the  substrate  of  AI-Enabled
Public

Services,

yet

ownership

and

control

are

often

fragmented

or

externalized.

Sovereign

data

governance

regimes

must

deﬁne

access,

consent,

and

reuse

across

systems.

DPI

primitives

such

as

identity,

registry,

and

consent

layers

must

include

traceability,

purpose

limitation,

and

public

oversight

by

default.

8.  Transparent  Governance  and  Independent  Oversight :  As  AI  becomes  embedded  in
critical

decisions

such

as

citizen

classiﬁcation

or

eligibility

ranking,

independent

oversight

is

essential.

Legal

authorities

must

be

empowered

to

inspect

deployments,

evaluate

safeguards,

and

publish

public

reports.

Redress

mechanisms

should

be

available

for

individuals

impacted

by

automated

decisions.

9.  Bridging  the  Digital  Divide  and  Ensuring  Inclusion :  Inclusion  is  non-negotiable.
Inclusion

must

be

embedded

in

every

block.

DPI-AI

systems

should

offer

multimodal

34 / 42

--- PAGE 35 ---

interfaces  such  as  voice,  SMS,  or  offline  access,  and  be  designed  for  populations  with
low

literacy,

poor

connectivity,

or

accessibility

needs.

User

research

with

underserved

groups

should

guide

workﬂow

design

from

the

start.

10.  Extending  Legacy  Systems  through  a  “+1”  Integration  Approach :  Governments
often

operate

legacy

systems

built

and

maintained

over

decades.

Replacing

them

wholesale

is

rarely

feasible.

Instead,

the

DPI-AI

Framework

encourages

a

+1

approach,

layering

new

capabilities

alongside

existing

systems,

enhancing

them

incrementally

without

requiring

full

redesign.

This

pragmatic

strategy

respects

institutional

realities

while

unlocking

innovation.

11.  Deﬁning  Public  versus  Private  AI  Blocks :  A  central  challenge  in  the  DPI–AI
Framework

is

determining

which

AI

Blocks

can

be

considered

part

of

public

infrastructure

and

which

should

remain

private.

This

question

is

core

to

current

debates

on

sovereign

and

public

interest

AI,

and

applies

to

both

foundational

capabilities

and

sector-speciﬁc

AI

Blocks

used

in

public

services.

While  some  AI  capabilities  may  qualify  as  public  if  they  are  openly  speciﬁed,  broadly
accessible,

and

governed

with

clear

policy

guardrails,

others

function

as

private

utilities

even

when

widely

adopted.

The

framework

therefore

needs

clear

criteria

for

when

public

workﬂows

can

rely

on

private

or

hybrid

AI

Blocks,

and

under

what

conditions.

Addressing

this

distinction

is

essential

for

sovereignty,

accountability,

and

public

trust.

Successfully  addressing  these  challenges  will  determine  whether  DPI-AI  adoption  enhances
trust,

transparency,

and

inclusion,

or

replicates

inequities

at

scale.

A

safeguards-ﬁrst,

modular

approach

ensures

that

governments

retain

control,

citizens

beneﬁt

directly,

and

innovation

is

channeled

toward

shared

public

purpose.

Conclusion
The  next  phase  of  digital  public  infrastructure  will  not  be  deﬁned  by  modular  components
alone,

but

by

the

intelligent

workﬂows

that

integrate

them

into

adaptive

systems.

It

is

in

the

dynamic

orchestration

of

these

components,

through

DPI

Workﬂows

and

Public

Agents,

that

real

public

value

is

created.

This  paper  has  outlined  a  practical  vision  for  that  future:  a  transition  from  vertically
integrated

Digital

Public

Goods

to

composable

AI

Blocks

that,

when

orchestrated

by

DPI

Workﬂows

and

activated

by

citizen-facing

Agents,

enable

faster,

fairer,

and

more

efficient

public

service

delivery

within

a

rights-based

architecture.

This  evolution  is  not  about  simulating  cognition  or  pursuing  artiﬁcial  general  intelligence.  It  is
about

equipping

governments

with

architectural

tools

to

modernize

public

services

incrementally,

using

reusable,

transparent,

and

purpose-built

components.

The

DPI–AI

Framework

demonstrates

how

this

can

be

achieved

by

placing

modularity,

local

adaptability,

and

public

governance

at

the

center

of

digital

transformation.

Governments  do  not  need  to  build  end-to-end  AI  systems.  They  need  to  build  interfaces
between

intelligence

and

infrastructure,

bridges

that

allow

AI

to

serve

public

needs

while

preserving

control,

equity,

and

trust.

That

means:

●  Designing  AI  as  infrastructure,  not  as  opaque  platforms.  ●  Treating  Digital  Public  Goods  as  composable  assets,  not  as  static  solutions.  ●  Integrating  intelligence  gradually,  as  DPI  integrated  identity,  payments,  and  data  into
a

shared

stack.

The  real  opportunity  lies  not  in  centralizing  intelligence,  but  in  distributing  it.  AI  Blocks
should

be

usable

across

systems,

contexts,

and

communities.

Each

Block

must

serve

a

public

function,

provide

transparency,

and

remain

accountable

to

public

institutions.

Just

as

APIs

enabled

interoperability

in

earlier

generations

of

digital

infrastructure,

emerging

open

standards

such

as

Model

Context

Protocols

(MCPs)

now

make

it

possible

for

AI

systems

to

interconnect

through

shared

context

layers.

These

protocols

extend

the

logic

of

DPI

by

ensuring

openness,

modularity,

and

auditability

within

AI

environments,

allowing

distributed

intelligence

to

function

as

a

coherent

public

system.

With

the

right

design

principles,

this

intelligence

becomes

a

durable

public

asset

rather

than

a

private

service.

DPI  Workﬂows  can  make  this  vision  tangible  by  becoming  sharable  recipes  for  service
delivery.

A

workﬂow

that

chains

together

identity

veriﬁcation,

eligibility

determination,

and

payments

can

be

published,

adapted,

and

reused

by

other

governments

or

agencies,

much

36 / 42

--- PAGE 37 ---

like  open-source  code  on  GitHub  or  containerized  applications  shared  through  Docker.  By
treating

workﬂows

as

reusable

templates,

countries

can

borrow

from

each

other’s

playbooks,

install

them

with

minimal

effort,

and

adapt

them

to

local

policies

and

contexts.

This  portability  transforms  AI-Enabled  Public  Services  into  a  global  commons  of  practice.
Instead

of

reinventing

solutions

in

silos,

governments

can

access

catalogs

of

pre-built

workﬂows

and

Blocks,

remix

them

for

their

own

needs,

and

share

improvements

back

into

the

ecosystem.

In

the

same

way

that

open-source

software

accelerated

private

innovation,

open

repositories

of

AI

Blocks

and

DPI

Workﬂows

can

accelerate

public

innovation
,

ensuring

that

solutions

scale

faster,

cost

less,

and

remain

accountable

to

shared

public

values.

If  DPI  was  the  foundation,  AI  blocks,  DPI  Workﬂows,  and  Agents  are  the  scaffolding  for
what

comes

next.

They

provide

a

modular,

ﬂexible,

and

accountable

way

to

deliver

smarter

services,

faster

responses,

and

broader

inclusion.

The

work

ahead

is

not

about

scaling

AI;

it

is

about

shaping

it

to

serve

the

public

stack

and

to

strengthen

the

capacity

of

governments

to

act

with

intelligence,

transparency,

and

purpose.

Glossary  of  Key  Concepts
Artiﬁcial  Intelligence  (AI):  Refers  to  computer  systems  that  learn  from  data  and  make
context-based

judgments

to

perform

tasks

such

as

understanding

language,

answering

questions,

executing

tasks,

recognizing

patterns,

solving

problems

or

generating

text

or

media.

Unlike

traditional

software

that

follows

ﬁxed

rules,

AI

systems

adapt

their

outputs

based

on

patterns

learned

during

training

and

ongoing

reinforcements.

The

most

visible

examples

today

are

Large

Language

Models

(LLMs),

which

are

powerful

models

trained

on

vast

amounts

of

data,

and

Small

Language

Models

(SLMs),

which

are

lighter

and

designed

to

run

on

smaller

devices

or

at

lower

cost.

AI  Block:  A  modular,  callable  function  that  can  be  invoked  within  a  public  workﬂow  to
perform

a

speciﬁc

task,

classiﬁed

as

foundational

(general-purpose)

or

contextual

(sector-speciﬁc),

built

on

democratized

multimodal

and

local-language

tools

for

inclusion,

and

able

to

operate

as

a

Digital

Public

Good

when

governed

by

open

standards

and

policy

guardrails,

just

as

existing

Digital

Public

Goods

can

themselves

serve

as

AI

Blocks

within

DPI

workﬂows.

Agentic  AI  (Agent) :  A  system  that  uses  AI  (LLM/SLM)  to  provide  information  and  also  take
actions.

Agents

can

connect

with

third-party

systems,

invoke

AI

blocks,

or

run

workﬂows

to

complete

tasks

such

as

searching

databases,

submitting

forms,

or

scheduling

appointments.

Chatbot  /  AI  Assistant :  A  type  of  agent  designed  for  conversation.  It  communicates  with
people

in

natural

language

and

can

also

trigger

external

functions,

workﬂows,

or

AI

blocks

to

guide

users

through

processes

or

perform

actions

on

their

behalf.

DPI  (Digital  Public  Infrastructure):  DPI  is  an  approach  to  digitalization  focused  on  creating
foundational,

digital

building

blocks

designed

for

the

public

beneﬁt.

This

approach

combines

open

technology

standards

with

robust

governance

frameworks

to

encourage

private

community

innovation

to

address

societal

scale

challenges

such

as

ﬁnancial

inclusion,

affordable

healthcare,

quality

education,

climate

change,

access

to

justice

and

beyond.

It’s

based

on

ﬁve

technology

architecture

principles:

1)

interoperability;

2)

minimalist,

reusable

building

blocks;

3)

Diverse,

inclusive

innovation

by

the

ecosystem;

4)

a

preference

for

remaining

federated

and

decentralised;

and

5)

security

&

privacy

by

design.

At

an

implementation

level,

this

approach

takes

shape

through

a

set

of

foundational,

interoperable

building

blocks,

such

as

(but

not

limited

to)

identiﬁers

and

registries;

data

sharing;

AI/ML

models;

trust

infra;

discovery

and

fulﬁlment;

and

payments.

DPI-AI  Framework:  A  design  approach  that  extends  Digital  Public  Infrastructure  by
connecting

AI

as

an

external,

interoperable

layer.

It

enables

modular

AI

capabilities—such

as

38 / 42

--- PAGE 39 ---

Public  Agents,  DPI  Workﬂows,  and  AI  Blocks—to  interact  with  DPI  systems  through  shared
standards,

governance,

and

safeguards.

The

framework

supports

adaptive

and

accountable

public

service

delivery

while

maintaining

openness,

transparency,

and

human

oversight.

DPG  (Digital  Public  Good):  Are  open-source  software,  open  standards,  open  data,  open  AI
systems,

and

open

content

collections

that

adhere

to

privacy

and

other

applicable

laws

and

best

practices,

do

no

harm,

and

help

attain

the

Sustainable

Development

Goals

(SDGs).

Callable  Function:  A  well-deﬁned  operation  exposed  by  a  DPG  or  AI  Block,  such  as  check_beneﬁt_eligibility() or  translate_document().  Callable  functions  can  be  invoked  inside
workﬂows

to

deliver

tasks

in

a

modular,

auditable,

and

reusable

way.

DPI  Workﬂow:  A  structured,  rule-based  sequence  of  steps  that  connects  agents,  AI  Blocks,
and

DPI

components.

Workﬂows

deﬁne

how

services

are

delivered,

ensuring

transparency,

safeguards,

and

policy

compliance.

They

can

be

shared

as

reusable

templates

across

governments,

much

like

open-source

code

or

containerized

applications.

Large  Language  Model  (LLM):  A  powerful  AI  model  trained  on  vast  amounts  of  text  data,
capable

of

generating

and

understanding

human-like

language

across

many

tasks.

Small  Language  Model  (SLM):  A  more  compact  AI  model  that  is  optimized  to  run  efficiently
on

smaller

devices

or

with

lower

computational

cost,

often

for

speciﬁc

domains.

GPT  (Generative  Pre-trained  Transformer) :  A  type  of  language  model  based  on  the
transformer

architecture,

trained

on

large

text

datasets

to

generate

and

understand

human-like

language.

Multi-Agent  Orchestration:  The  coordination  of  multiple  AI  systems  or  agents  to  complete
complex

public

tasks.

Enabled

by

shared

protocols

and

workﬂows,

orchestration

allows

collaboration

across

systems

in

a

transparent,

rights-preserving,

and

policy-aligned

way.

Model  Context  Protocol  (MCP) :  A  technical  standard  that  enables  interoperability  between
AI

models

and

external

systems

by

deﬁning

a

shared

context

layer

for

data

exchange.

Within

the

DPI-AI

Framework,

MCP

allows

AI

modules

to

interact

safely

with

Digital

Public

Infrastructure

components,

such

as

identity,

payments,

and

data

exchange

systems.

It

ensures

that

AI

functions

can

be

invoked

as

governed,

modular

services

while

maintaining

auditability,

transparency,

and

control.

+1  Approach:  A  method  of  modernizing  legacy  systems  by  adding  interoperable  layers,
rather

than

replacing

them.

AI

Blocks

and

DPI

wrappers

extend

functionality

without

disrupting

core

systems.

39 / 42

--- PAGE 40 ---

Public  Agent :  An  AI-powered  assistant  integrated  into  government  systems.  Public  agents
can

invoke

third-party

functions,

AI

blocks,

or

workﬂows

to

help

citizens

navigate

rights,

beneﬁts,

and

obligations,

and

to

support

governments

in

delivering

services

that

are

inclusive,

transparent,

and

efficient.

Cognition  (in  AI  claims) :  The  capacity  to  perceive,  reason  and  understand,  normally
associated

with

human

thought.

When

applied

to

AI

systems,

cognition

is

a

metaphor

rather

than

a

literal

capability.

AI

models

do

not

truly

comprehend

or

think;

they

operate

by

detecting

patterns

in

data

and

generating

outputs

statistically,

without

awareness,

intentionality

or

genuine

understanding.

AI-Enabled  Public  Services:  A  vision  of  digital  public  infrastructure  extended  with  modular,
rights-aligned

AI

capabilities.

Rather

than

concentrating

decision-making

in

centralized

systems,

it

embeds

callable

functions

into

workﬂows

that

are

transparent,

auditable,

and

reusable.

These

capabilities

allow

governments

to

deliver

services

that

are

adaptive

and

citizen-centric,

while

ensuring

accountability,

inclusion,

and

public

oversight.

Tool :  A  callable  function  that  an  Agent  can  use  to  perform  a  speciﬁc  operation.  In  practice,
tools

expose

a

structured

interface

(often

via

JSON

Schema)

that

deﬁnes

inputs

and

outputs,

enabling

agents

(LLMs

or

SLMs)

to

interact

with

external

systems,

data

sources,

or

services.

Within

the

DPI-AI

Framework,

tools

are

instantiated

as

AI

Blocks

(e.g.,
 verify_identity(),  check_beneﬁt_eligibility(),  translate_local_language()).  Tools  provide  the  atomic,  auditable
actions

that

Agents

orchestrate

through

DPI

Workﬂows

to

deliver

public

services

in

a

modular

and

transparent

way.

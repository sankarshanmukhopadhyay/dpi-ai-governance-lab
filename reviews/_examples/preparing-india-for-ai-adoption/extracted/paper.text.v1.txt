Abstract
Artificial Intelligence (AI) is quickly changing economies and societies around the world. It is
being used in healthcare, farming, education, and government to make systems more
efficient, accurate, and scalable. India, with its young population, large amounts of data, and
growing digital ecosystem, is well-placed to benefit from this AI revolution. But to unlock its
full potential, India must overcome several challenges—such as gaps in technology,
infrastructure, education, regulation, and ethics. This essay looks at the main obstacles to AI
adoption in India and suggests practical solutions for building a sustainable and inclusive AI-
powered future.
India’s digital infrastructure has made significant progress in recent years through initiatives
such as Digital India, the JAM Trinity (Jan Dhan, Aadhaar, Mobile), and the India Stack,
which includes UPI, Aadhaar, and Data Exchanges (Ref 1 and 2). However, gaps remain,
especially in rural and semi-urban areas. AI requires strong digital connectivity, high-
performance computing, and reliable cloud services. Limited access to high-speed internet in
remote regions restricts the rollout of AI-powered solutions such as telemedicine, smart
farming, and e-learning. Today, AI needs special hardware – such hardware has to be
imported and is one of the major hinderance for AI becoming widespread in India.
AI also depends heavily on data. While India generates vast amounts of it, much of the data is
not properly classified, fragmented, or siloed. Access to high-quality, annotated, and diverse
datasets is limited, and there are few interoperable platforms or standardized protocols in key
sectors like health, agriculture, and education.
To address these challenges, India can focus on a few key solutions:
 Build public-private partnerships to expand digital infrastructure in underserved areas.
 Accelerate 5G rollout and leverage satellite internet initiatives like Starlink and
BharatNet to achieve nationwide coverage.
 Establish regional AI infrastructure hubs with compute clusters and data centres
outside major cities.
 Create national data exchanges with sector-specific platforms to enable sharing of
anonymized, structured data.
 Expand open data initiatives with clear APIs and compliance rules.
 Develop data stewardship models that ensure ethical collection and use of data, with
user consent, privacy protections, and participatory governance.

India has several initiatives to establish data exchange platforms, including the
upcoming National Data Platform (NDP) for a unified national data marketplace and the
operational India Urban Data Exchange (IUDX), which facilitates secure data sharing for
urban development. Another key initiative is the Agricultural Data Exchange (ADeX), a
consent-based platform for sharing agricultural data. These platforms are designed to promote
data-driven decision-making, innovation, and the development of data-based ecosystems
across various sectors. However, these efforts are seriously in need of public out reach
programmes.
India’s education system is not yet fully aligned with the needs of an AI-driven economy.
While top institutes like the IITs and IISc are advancing AI research, most other institutions
face challenges such as outdated curricula, a shortage of qualified faculty, and limited access
to hands-on AI tools. As a result, there is a shortage of skilled AI professionals, particularly
in Tier 2 and Tier 3 cities. Possible solutions include updating school and college curricula to
integrate AI, machine learning, and data science under the National Education Policy (NEP);
introducing faculty development programs through workshops, online courses, and industry-
academia partnerships; expanding accessible AI learning via government initiatives like
SWAYAM and Skill India in collaboration with platforms such as Coursera, edX, and
NPTEL; and creating AI-focused vocational training programs for ITI students, working
professionals, and entrepreneurs.
As AI systems begin to influence decisions that directly affect people’s lives, it is essential to
ensure transparency, accountability, and fairness. At present, India does not have a
comprehensive AI policy or legal framework to deal with issues such as algorithmic bias,
surveillance, data protection, and liability in automated systems. There are several strategy
papers – salient amongst them are from the Niti Aayog (Ref 3). and India AI mission (Ref 4).
The India AI mission has seven pillars: India AI Innovation centre for the deployment of
indigenous LLMs, India AI Application Development Initiative for AI applications’
development in critical sectors, AI Kosh Data Platform for creating datasets, models and
toolkits for innovation in AI platforms, India AI Compute Capacity for providing IT
infrastructure for AI, India AI Start-up Financing, India AI Future Skill for training
manpower and Safe and Trusted AI for creating adequate guardrails for development,
deployment and adoption of responsible AI.
Possible solutions include formulating strong AI ethics guidelines in line with global
standards such as those from the OECD and UNESCO, with a focus on inclusivity, fairness,
and transparency; setting up regulatory sandboxes where startups and companies can test AI
solutions under oversight; developing adaptive legal frameworks for emerging technologies
through regular consultations and expert reviews; and creating a national AI ethics board to
oversee large-scale deployments and track their societal impact.
India has over 22 official languages and hundreds of dialects, but most AI systems are trained
on English-focused datasets. This limits their ability to reflect the country’s rich linguistic
and cultural diversity. If AI tools are not designed with inclusion in mind, they risk widening
social inequalities, especially for marginalized communities whose specific needs are often
overlooked. Possible solutions include strengthening the Bhashini initiative (Ref 4) to
develop multilingual AI tools such as speech-to-text, machine translation, and natural
language processing across Indian languages; involving local communities in the design of

AI applications tailored to their contexts, whether in tribal healthcare, rural education, or
urban sanitation; creating and open-sourcing region-specific datasets that capture diverse
voices, accents, and cultural contexts; and promoting greater participation of women and
minority groups in AI development teams to reduce bias and support more equitable
adoption.
India lags behind global leaders in areas such as AI research output, patents, and startup
funding. While institutes like the IITs and IISc produce high-quality research, there is still a
strong need for closer collaboration between industry and academia, as well as better
pathways to turn research into commercial applications. Niti Aayog report says that India has
less than 100 researchers out of a worldwide number of 25000.
Possible solutions include setting up National AI Research Centres or Centres of Excellence
across regions, modelled on successful global institutions; supporting AI startups in sectors
like health tech, edtech, aggrotech, and fintech with seed funding, mentorship, and testing
facilities; building international collaborations with leading countries and organizations to
share knowledge and best practices; and boosting domestic startups by integrating their AI
solutions into public service delivery through platforms like the Government e-Marketplace
(GeM). Integration of AI with Digital Public Infrastructure (DPI) will give rise to interesting
possibilities – large amount of data availability for training and multi-lingual capabilities of
AI can be extremely beneficial to DPI.  Public understanding of AI in India is still limited.
Many people are unclear about what AI is, how it works, and what its impacts might be. This
lack of awareness can lead to fear, misinformation, or resistance, especially when AI is
introduced in sensitive areas like healthcare or law enforcement.
Possible solutions include running mass awareness campaigns through media, digital literacy
programs, and local-language content to explain AI’s benefits and limits; using community
engagement models where citizens are involved and educated during pilot deployments;
investing in explainable AI systems that can justify their decisions in simple, human-
understandable terms to build trust; and creating citizen feedback mechanisms so users can
report errors, biases, or harms caused by AI systems, ensuring they improve over time.
As AI adoption increases, new concerns are emerging around environmental impact, misuse,
and employment. Training large AI models requires significant energy, raising sustainability
challenges. AI can also be misused for harmful purposes such as deepfakes and
misinformation, while automation poses risks of job displacement. The biggest fear is a
scenario where AI could lead to large scale unemployment (Ref 6). India needs to ensure that
AI growth balances people, environment, and productivity.
Possible solutions include promoting energy-efficient AI models and infrastructure powered
by renewable energy; prioritizing AI projects that address social challenges in health, the
environment, disaster management, and poverty reduction; launching reskilling and transition
programs for workers whose jobs may be affected by automation; and funding research on
responsible AI that emphasizes fairness, inclusivity, and sustainability.

Conclusion
AI presents both a challenge and an opportunity for India. It has the potential to address some
of the country’s most critical needs, such as better healthcare, quality education, sustainable
farming, and more efficient governance. However, these benefits will only be realized if
adoption is proactive, inclusive, and ethical. By strengthening the infrastructure, improving
data systems, encouraging innovation, and building human skills, India can not only adopt AI
but also play a role in shaping its global future. What is needed is more than a policy—it is a
national effort that prepares every citizen, institution, and business for the era of intelligent
machines.

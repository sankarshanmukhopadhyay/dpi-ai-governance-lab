The pace of change is already\nextraordinary – and it is accelerating.\nThis is a revolution that leaders cannot opt out of. Those who move fast to\ndeploy AI across their economies and institutions will gain a lasting\nadvantage. Those who do not will see their ability to influence events –\nabroad and at home – progressively diminished.\nThis is why AI matters so much to the question of sovereignty today. The\nsystems that will define the future require massive amounts of capital, talent\nand energy. They depend on global supply chains, and economies of scale\nmean that frontier AI development is likely to remain concentrated among a\nsmall number of actors.\nFaced with this reality, many leaders are now asking what steps they should\ntake to stay in control of their country’s future. The instinctive response is\noften to try to do everything at home – to build fully “sovereign” AI and treat\nreliance on partners as a threat.\nThis report argues that while this instinct is understandable, it is also wrong.\nFull self-sufficiency is too expensive, too slow and, for most countries, simply\nimpossible. More importantly, it misrepresents what sovereignty really means\nin a digital, global and interconnected world.\nSovereignty should not mean independence from all others. Rather, it should\nbe viewed as the ability to act strategically – with agency and choice – in a\nworld that is irreversibly interdependent.

Leaders must make\ndeliberate choices about where they want to build strength and influence.\nAnd by becoming indispensable in specific parts of the AI ecosystem –\nwhether in data assets, specialised models, regulatory standards, energy\ncapacity or talent pipelines – countries gain leverage across it, even if they\ndo not control it all.\nCrucially, sovereignty must not become an excuse for avoiding frontier AI.\nFailing to access and apply the best systems is itself one of the greatest\nthreats to sovereignty today. Countries that cannot use these tools will\nbecome dependent on those that can – less able to defend themselves,\ndrive economic growth or deliver public services effectively. Isolation and\nprotectionism do not protect sovereignty; they weaken it.\nLeaders should therefore resist the urge to own every model and data\ncentre, and instead prioritise securing access to frontier capabilities, building\ndomestic strengths where they matter most, and governing AI in line with\nnational priorities and values.\nThis is also a question about the kind of state we want to build.

Countries that fail to adopt and deploy AI at\nscale risk ceding their competitiveness and, ultimately, elements of their\nsovereignty to those who do.\nIn the age of AI, no country can claim complete self-sufficiency. Developing\nand deploying frontier AI requires enormous resources: billions of dollars in\ncompute, data and engineering talent, alongside hyperscale data centres\nand cutting-edge semiconductors. These capabilities are overwhelmingly\nconcentrated in the United States and China, which together control more\nthan 90 per cent of global AI data-centre capacity. Most states will never be\nable to build or sustain frontier AI infrastructure on their own.\nThe dependencies this creates are increasingly seen as either strategic\nvulnerabilities or levers of geopolitical influence. Countries are left to\nconfront a choice about how to remain competitive in the AI era: join the\nresource-intensive race to train the world’s most advanced models or focus\non deploying AI at scale, bolstering competitiveness through deployment\nrather than domestic frontier systems.\nThis landscape leaves governments confronting two defining questions:\nwhat is sovereign AI capability, and how can nations develop and exercise\nit? In response, calls for “AI sovereignty” are emerging, presented as an\nimperative to exercise exclusive control over frontier technology and its use,\nto build domestic capabilities and to enforce stricter regulations on foreign\ntechnology.

Sovereignty in the age of AI is not a binary condition to be achieved\nor lost. It is fundamentally a question of agency and choice – the ability of a\nstate to make deliberate, future-oriented decisions about how AI is\nintegrated, governed and used in line with its national goals.\nSovereignty is shaped by how well countries configure and negotiate their\nposition within an inherently interdependent technological system. This\nrequires balancing a persistent trilemma: pursuing control by investing in\ndomestic capability, accessing frontier capability through global systems,\nand ensuring coherence across regulatory, industrial, fiscal and diplomatic\nstrategies. No state can maximise all three simultaneously. The task of\nmodern statecraft is to manage these trade-offs within the layers of the AI\nstack in ways that preserve strategic autonomy and expand national agency\nover time.\nEffective AI sovereignty therefore cannot be pursued through isolation. It\nmust be deliberately negotiated. Governments will need to cultivate\ndomestic strengths where they matter most, secure predictable access to\nfrontier capabilities, design partnerships that preserve flexibility, and invest in\nthe institutions and talent required to evaluate, govern and adapt AI systems.\nAbove all, national competitiveness in the AI era will depend as much on\ndeploying AI widely across the economy and public sector as on building\nfrontier models themselves. For many countries, this path will deliver far\ngreater returns than entering the resource-intensive race to train the world’s\nmost advanced systems.\nThe choices that decision-makers make today will have considerable,\nenduring consequences for their countries’ futures.\nThis paper offers political leaders and key decision-makers a practical guide\nto shaping the strongest possible national position in this rapidly changing\ntechno-geopolitical landscape.

It provides a new framework to help governments assess\nthe trade-offs at each layer of the AI stack, illustrated with examples of how\ncountries are tackling these choices today.\nFrom this, we identify seven strategic levers through which governments can\nexpand agency in the age of AI:\n1. Secure access to frontier AI models and compute. Governments\nshould prioritise accessing frontier AI capabilities. They need to formulate\na clear view on what can be done using internationally derived models\nand sources of compute, and what must absolutely be done domestically\nand how much compute that would require.\n2. Accelerate AI adoption and diffusion across sectors. Countries must\nensure they are able to adopt and diffuse AI at scale. The value of AI will\nonly be realised when it is widely adopted across the economy, which will\nbolster national prospects.\n3. Aggregate and signal national demand to shape the AI market. Every\ncountry is competing for frontier access, and global providers and\ninvestors will prioritise countries that demonstrate strong, coordinated\ndemand for AI.\n4. Treat interoperability as a core component of sovereignty.\nGovernments should prioritise building open, modular and interoperable\nsystems to improve customisability, avoid lock-in and enhance resilience\nto better control their digital futures.\n5. Build and scale smaller, efficient and contextually relevant models. Not\nevery country needs to build frontier models, but the use of open-weight\nand small language models tailored to national needs can create\nsignificant value.\n6.

However, this\nrequirement is often overstated in the pursuit of AI sovereignty. A baseline of\nsovereign capability matters, but replicating frontier-scale capability is\nneither feasible nor necessary for most countries.13 At the same time, states\nthat fail to adopt AI and deploy it at scale will find themselves rapidly falling\nbehind, not because they lack frontier models but because they fail to\nconvert available capability into public value.

As our\nreport Governing in the Age of AI: A New Model to Transform the State\nemphasises, the transformative impact of AI on the state materialises only\nwhen it is embedded into real systems of delivery, decision-making and\nadministration.\nGovernments therefore face a strategic trade-off between building\napplications domestically, buying them externally or pursuing hybrid\napproaches. Domestic development allows countries to embed national\nnorms, tailor systems to local institutions and retain greater control over\nsensitive sectors such as health care, finance and public administration.\nBuying applications offers speed and lower cost, but risks reinforcing\ndependency, reducing future flexibility and embedding foreign standards.\nSOVEREIGNTY IN THE AGE OF AI: STRATEGIC CHOICES, STRUCTURAL DEPENDENCIES AND THE LONG GAME AHEAD\n23\n"

The scale, speed\nand complexity of AI development mean that each state must navigate\nthese trade-offs and make strategic choices about which capabilities to\nhold domestically, where to shape markets and norms, and where to rely\ndeliberately on others.\nTo illustrate these variations in practice, this paper proposes a new\nframework for understanding how governments exercise agency in the AI\nera: Control, Steer, Depend (CSD). This new taxonomy captures how\ngovernments exercise agency within an interdependent AI ecosystem,\ndifferentiating between postures of direct control, influence and managed\ndependence that, collectively, define the full spectrum of AI sovereignty.\nImportantly, countries rarely adopt a single posture across all layers of the AI\nstack. Instead, sovereignty emerges from their unique configuration of\npostures across AI systems.\nThe framework delineates three core postures:\nControl: Direct Command Over Strategic Systems\nGovernments adopt a Control posture when they judge certain AI systems\nas too critical to outsource. This strategic orientation is often characterised\nby ensuring direct ownership, legal authority or exclusive operational\ncommand over AI infrastructure, data sets or governance mechanisms.\nControl provides the strongest form of insulation against external shocks,\nbut it is also capital-intensive and operationally demanding. More\nimportantly, control is not synonymous with nationalisation or autarky.

Governments steer through\nregulation, procurement, partnerships and the development of standards\nthat help shape markets and norms. Many countries also amplify their\nsteering capacity by collaborating through regional organisations, enabling\nthem to pool leverage and coordinate positions.\nSteering is often the most practical approach.

Its approach is one of strategic\nhybridisation, combining a state-guided model of ecosystem co-creation\nwith regulatory authority and a clean and abundant energy matrix to build\ndomestic capability while remaining open to global partnerships. Brazil is\nanchoring key elements of the AI stack, from data governance to energy\nsecurity and emerging compute infrastructure, while using public policy to\nsteer both domestic actors and foreign investors towards national priorities.\nBrazil’s capability-building model is rooted in co-creation rather than\nisolation. Public institutions, universities and domestic firms are developing\nPortuguese-language and regionally aligned models such as SoberanIA,\nAmazônia 360 and GovBERT-BR. These initiatives are supported by\nsignificant public R&D commitments (approximately $4 billion under the AI\nPlan 2024–2028), and increasing international cooperation, including the\nChina–Brazil joint AI lab.61 Brazil also leverages its regulatory power and\nenergy sovereignty to attract hyperscale investments.\nWhile Brazil depends on foreign providers for cloud services, advanced\nchips and foundation models, it manages these dependencies through\nregulatory strength and investment conditionalities. Major commitments\nincluding Microsoft’s $2.7 billion commitment, AWS’s $1.8 billion expansion\nand Scala’s 4.75 GW AI City all follow reinvestment, localisation and\ncompliance requirements that ensure global compute capability is physically\nand economically anchored on Brazilian soil.62,63,64 This combination of\nenforcement capability and infrastructural advantage allows Brazil to attract\nand condition global capability while building local industry.\nBrazil’s posture differs from India’s DPI-anchored model of layered control,\nthe UAE’s frontier acceleration strategy driven by capital and global\npartnerships, and Japan’s resilience-first approach centred on fallback\ncapacity. Its distinctiveness lies in its combination of regulatory leverage,\nsupported by a favourable energy base and large internal market, which\ntogether allow it to shape how foreign capability enters and operates\nSOVEREIGNTY IN THE AGE OF AI: STRATEGIC CHOICES, STRUCTURAL DEPENDENCIES AND THE LONG GAME AHEAD\n49\n"

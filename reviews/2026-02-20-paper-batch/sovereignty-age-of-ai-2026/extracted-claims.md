# Paper analysis — Sovereignty in the Age of AI: Strategic Choices, Structural Dependencies and the Long Game Ahead

## 1. Architectural Primitives Extracted

- **Identity rails:** Not central; sovereignty framed at national-stack level, not citizen-level delegation.
- **Data exchange layer:** Strong emphasis on data as strategic asset, representation, and governance trade-offs; limited operational primitives.
- **AI capability layer:** Uses a layered **AI stack** (compute, energy, data, models, applications, talent, governance) and introduces **Control / Steer / Depend (CSD)** as posture taxonomy.
- **Governance assumptions:** Assumes states can steer through regulation/procurement/standards; under-specifies runtime accountability and redress.

## 2. Institutional Risk Surfaces

| Risk | Failure Mode | Likelihood | Impact | Priority |
|------|-------------|------------|--------|----------|
| “Sovereignty as a service” trap | Local clouds/compliance wrappers simulate autonomy while deepening dependency | High | High | P1 |
| Strategy without operating model | CSD posture described, but not converted into control objectives + evidence | Medium | High | P1 |
| DPI blind spot | National strategy ignores citizen-facing runtime governance (appeals, logs, decision rights) | Medium | High | P1 |
| Interoperability rhetoric | “Interoperability” named, but not defined as testable conformance | Medium | High | P2 |
| Over-focus on frontier access | Adoption push without tiering leads to rights-affecting deployments without safeguards | Medium | High | P1 |

## 3. Risk-to-Tier Mapping

Map CSD to Tiered workflows:

- **Tier 0–1:** Depend is acceptable (global models), if audit + policy constraints exist.
- **Tier 2:** requires Steer posture at minimum (procurement conditions, audit rights, contestability).
- **Tier 3:** should require Control on *runtime governance* (kill switch, rollback, jurisdictional enforcement), even if models/compute are dependent.

## 4. Governance Binding

Convert “policy levers” into DPI-grade bindings:

- **Controller:** define sovereign workloads, publish posture declarations per layer (compute/data/models/workflows).
- **Providers:** contractual audit rights, non-interruption clauses, incident reporting SLAs.
- **Operators:** fallback capacity for critical services; workload isolation; exit playbooks; interoperability requirements.
- **Escalation:** geopolitics shocks, provider policy changes, model drift → automatic suspension pathways.

## 5. Standards Alignment

- **NIST AI RMF / ISO 42001:** compatible at the strategy layer, but needs “minimum viable upgrades” to become implementable.
- **DPI building blocks:** strong narrative fit (especially for India), but would benefit from explicit DPI architecture patterns and conformance artifacts.

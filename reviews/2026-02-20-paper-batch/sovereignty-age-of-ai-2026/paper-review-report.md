# Paper review report — Sovereignty in the Age of AI: Strategic Choices, Structural Dependencies and the Long Game Ahead

## 1. Executive framing
- **Thesis:** AI sovereignty is agency under interdependence; states should choose where to Control, where to Steer, and where to Depend across the AI stack.
- **What the paper gets right:** The CSD taxonomy is a sharp strategic instrument and the seven policy levers are actionable at the national-planning layer.
- **What it misses:** Translation from strategy into implementable governance artifacts (control objectives, evidence, runtime accountability, and DPI-grade redress).

## 2. Use-case and tier mapping
- **Candidate use-cases:** National portfolios span Tier 0–3, especially in public services.
- **Tier mapping + justification:**
  - CSD should be mapped to tiered workflows. Tier 2/3 requires stronger “Steer/Control” on runtime governance even if compute/models are dependent.

## 3. Accountability and runtime governance
- Accountability chain present? **No (strategy-level only)**
- Escalation triggers present? **No (not operationalised)**
- Kill switch / rollback present? **No**

## 4. Data exchange governance
- Stewardship model: **Discussed conceptually** (data as strategic asset).
- Auditability: **Acknowledges auditability gaps**, doesn’t specify audit artifacts.
- Secondary use controls: **Not specified**.

## 5. Conformance profile alignment
- Profile Basic: **Indirect** (interoperability emphasis).
- Profile Decision Support: **Missing** (no contestability record requirements).
- Profile Automated Action: **Missing** (no Tier 3 gating).

## 6. Redress and remedy
- Contestability: **Not operationalised**.
- SLAs: **Absent**.
- Remedies: **Absent**.

## 7. Sovereignty / compute dependence
- Key dependencies: Compute, chips, cloud, frontier models, energy supply chains.
- Resilience posture: Advocates diversified options; needs concrete exit + fallback playbooks.

## 8. Required artifacts missing
- Missing dossier elements: posture declarations per AI stack layer; workload classification; sovereign workload inventory.
- Missing evaluation elements: minimum evaluation + monitoring for critical public deployments.
- Missing governance plumbing: incident escalation, audit logs, redress pathways, kill switch.

## 9. Recommendations (minimal viable upgrades)
1. Add a **posture declaration template** (CSD per layer) with evidence fields.
2. Define **sovereign workload tiers** (Tier 0–3) and bind them to procurement conditions.
3. Publish a minimal **interoperability conformance checklist** (testable).
4. Add a **runtime governance annex** (decision rights, drift triggers, suspension/rollback).
5. Add **redress requirements** for public-service deployments (Tier 2/3).

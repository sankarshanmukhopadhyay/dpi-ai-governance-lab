# Review report (draft)

This review is produced using the DPI AI Governance Lab artifacts.

## Key gap closure targets

- Introduce **risk-tier binding** for DPI-scale deployments
- Define **runtime accountability and escalation plumbing**
- Require a deployable **AI Deployment Dossier** for Tier 2–3
- Specify **data exchange governance** beyond general stewardship language
- Surface **compute dependency** as leverage risk, not only capacity

(See `/artifacts/*` for the normative machinery.)

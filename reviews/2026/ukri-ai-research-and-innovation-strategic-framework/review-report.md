# Review report (draft)

This review is produced using the DPI AI Governance Lab artifacts.

## What the framework gets right (signal)

- **Six clear action areas** create a readable “portfolio view” that can be mapped to investments, owners, and KPIs.
- **Whole-system posture** (skills + infrastructure + research + adoption + responsibility) is the right scope for national AI advantage.
- Explicit recognition that **responsibility and security are not optional** (alignment, environmental impact, malicious use, regulation).
- The ambition for **validated/assured systems in regulated sectors by 2031** is the correct north star.

## Where it under-delivers (execution risk)

This is a strategy with strong intent but thin “operational muscle”. The gaps below are the difference between *a narrative* and *a program you can audit*.

### Key gap closure targets

- Bind “responsible and trustworthy AI” to a **risk-tier model** and minimum artifact requirements per tier (so “assured” means something measurable).
- Publish a **delivery plan with owners, milestones, and leading indicators** (not just future intent).
- Specify what an **assurance toolchain** is (reference architecture, interfaces, evidence formats, and who runs/maintains it).
- Define a **regulator–adopter–researcher handshake** for regulated sector testbeds (approvals, monitoring, incident response, redress).
- Make **compute, data, and TRE governance** operational: access controls, auditability, revocation semantics, and sustainability reporting.

## “Lab-to-market” operationalization proposals (artifacts to add)

These are concrete deliverables UKRI (or partners) can sponsor, publish, and keep current.

1. **AI Deployment Dossier (regulated-sector baseline)**  
   Minimum evidence pack for validated deployment: model/system description, intended use, controls, evaluation, monitoring, incident handling, redress, and change management.

2. **Assurance Toolchain Reference Architecture**  
   A modular blueprint for testing, evaluation, monitoring, audit logging, provenance, and policy enforcement (with interoperability and evidence export in mind).

3. **Regulated Sector Testbed Playbook**  
   Step-by-step runbooks to stand up and operate testbeds with regulators: entry criteria, data controls, KPIs, failure modes, escalation paths, and public reporting.

4. **Compute & Data Governance Charter (TRE + model release)**  
   Governance for datasets, TRE operations, and model releases derived from UKRI resources, including privacy posture and accountability.

5. **Sustainability & Environmental Impact Reporting Pack**  
   Standardized reporting for compute emissions, efficiency measures, and trade-offs (because “green AI” won’t happen via vibes).

## Bottom line

The framework is a good “strategic wrapper”. To reduce execution risk and avoid turning “assured AI by 2031” into a slogan, UKRI will need an enforceable governance stack: risk-tier binding, mandatory evidence artifacts, and programmatic accountability (owners, metrics, auditability).

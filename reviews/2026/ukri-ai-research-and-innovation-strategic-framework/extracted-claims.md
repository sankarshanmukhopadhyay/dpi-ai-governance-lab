# Extracted claims (from the UKRI AI R&I Strategic Framework)

This is a working extraction for review and debate. Claims are phrased in plain language and grouped to make the strategy *operationally tractable*.

## Vision & positioning

- AI is transforming society rapidly and will become as ubiquitous as statistics or computers.
- The UK is positioned to benefit through people and partnerships; UKRI is a pivotal actor to translate research strength into national advantage.
- UKRI frames itself as an end-to-end value-chain funder (skills → infrastructure → technology development → adoption).

## UKRI role & operating model

- UKRI will act as investor, convenor and enabler across the AI ecosystem.
- UKRI intends to take a whole-system view to integrate responsible AI and national priorities beyond what markets deliver.
- UKRI will embed “clear behaviours” across councils, institutes and facilities:
  - Output-focused: invest for tangible results through co-creation and responsible adoption
  - From ideas to impact: simplify programmes, remove barriers, push prototypes and scale-up
  - People first: build UK-wide skills and cross-domain adoption capacity
  - Agile, long-term funder: balance high-risk/high-reward while safeguarding long-term capabilities
  - Cohere and convene: align programmes and connect discovery to deployment

## Six priority action areas

UKRI will direct investments and partnerships across six action areas:

1. Technology development and future foundations
2. AI transforming research (AI for science and research productivity)
3. Developing AI skills and talent
4. Accelerating innovation and adoption for economic growth and societal benefit
5. Championing responsible and trustworthy AI
6. Building world-class AI-enabling data and infrastructure

## Target outcomes (selected)

- By 2031, validated/assured AI systems should operate in regulated sectors with demonstrable safety, fairness and accountability, supported by UKRI research and “assurance toolchains”.
- Policy, regulation and public trust should adapt based on stronger evidence from UKRI-funded studies.
- UK co-leadership on global standards for safer/greener AI through international partnerships.
- Open, more environmentally sustainable compute and data foundations with equitable access for AI research (including models released based on these resources).
- Reusable, privacy-respecting datasets and Trusted Research Environments (TREs) that accelerate discovery and benefit data providers.
- Delivery plan will follow and be regularly updated.

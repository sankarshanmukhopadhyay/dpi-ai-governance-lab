# AI Deployment Dossier guidance (v0.1)

This dossier is the minimal packaging needed to make a DPI AI deployment **auditable**, **contestable**, and **rollback-ready**.

- Treat it as an operational artifact, not a compliance essay.
- Prefer links to evidence (logs, evaluation runs, approvals) over prose.

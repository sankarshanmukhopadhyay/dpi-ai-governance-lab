# Kill switch and rollback (v0.1)

A kill switch is not a button. It is:
- an authority model
- an operational procedure
- a tested recovery path

Tier 2–3 deployments MUST document:
- who can activate rollback
- what systems are affected
- how decision records are preserved
- how users are notified (where appropriate)

# DPI–AI Governance Lab

A structured doctrine and tooling repository for analyzing and operationalizing AI within Digital Public Infrastructure (DPI) ecosystems.

This repository transforms vision papers into enforceable governance artifacts by binding institutional risk to workflow class, accountability roles, and escalation pathways.

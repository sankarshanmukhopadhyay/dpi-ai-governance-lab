# DPI–AI Governance Lab

A working laboratory of structured critiques, governance models, risk matrices, and assurance artifacts built around AI, Digital Public Infrastructure (DPI), and agentic systems.

This repository stores reproducible markdown annexes, workflow tiers, control mappings, accountability models, and governance blueprints derived from public vision papers and policy frameworks.

## Current Focus

### DPI–AI Framework (CDPI, 2026)

Original paper:
https://digitalpublicinfrastructure.ai/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Vision_Paper_-DPI-AI-Framework_2026_CDPI.pdf

This repository contains structured governance extensions including:

- DPI–AI Risk Scoring Matrix
- Risk-to-Tier-to-Governance Binding Model
- Agentic Control Surface Mapping
- Public-Agent Identity Accountability Model

---

## Methodology

All artifacts follow a structured evaluation process:

1. Extract architectural primitives from the source paper
2. Identify institutional risk surfaces
3. Apply likelihood × impact scoring
4. Bind risk priority to workflow tiering
5. Map governance roles and accountability boundaries

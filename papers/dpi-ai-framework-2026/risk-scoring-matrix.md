# DPI–AI Risk Scoring Matrix

Scoring:
Likelihood (L): 1–5
Impact (I): 1–5
Priority = L × I

| # | Risk | Failure Mode | L | I | Priority |
|---|------|-------------|---|---|----------|
| 1 | Mandate ambiguity | Agent executes action without legally valid authority chain | 4 | 5 | 20 |
| 2 | Workflow inconsistency | Different ministries implement divergent orchestration logic | 4 | 4 | 16 |
| 3 | Data access overreach | Authorized access expands beyond original purpose | 4 | 5 | 20 |
| 4 | Training data legitimacy gap | Public data reused for training without durable rights basis | 3 | 5 | 15 |
| 5 | AI Block supply-chain compromise | Vendor swap or dependency injection risk | 3 | 5 | 15 |
| 6 | Safeguard bypass | Safeguards exist but are overridden by default | 4 | 5 | 20 |
| 7 | Contestability failure | Citizen cannot meaningfully appeal decision | 4 | 5 | 20 |
| 8 | Identity-authority misbinding | Correct identity, wrong authority assumed | 3 | 5 | 15 |
| 9 | Cross-agency accountability gap | Harm occurs, responsibility diffuses | 4 | 4 | 16 |
|10 | Interoperability lock-in | Nominal standards mask practical vendor lock-in | 3 | 4 | 12 |
|11 | Compute cost escalation | Inference and scaling costs become structural burden | 4 | 3 | 12 |
|12 | DPI maturity mismatch | AI layered onto weak registries and APIs | 4 | 4 | 16 |

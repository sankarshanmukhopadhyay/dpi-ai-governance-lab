# Risk-to-Tier-to-Governance Binding Model

## Step 1: Risk Priority Thresholds

- Priority 12–15 → Tier 1 (Advisory with Human Oversight)
- Priority 16–19 → Tier 2 (Conditional Automation)
- Priority ≥ 20 → Tier 3 (High Impact Determination)

## Step 2: Tier-Driven Governance Requirements

| Tier | Risk Level | Mandatory Controls | Governance Escalation |
|------|------------|-------------------|----------------------|
| Tier 0 | Minimal | Logging, traceability | Internal review only |
| Tier 1 | Moderate | Explanation artifacts, override logging | Agency-level oversight |
| Tier 2 | High | Binding safeguards, delegation tokens, audit bundle | Cross-agency reporting |
| Tier 3 | Critical | Human-in-loop confirmation, formal appeals, independent audit | Ecosystem governor review |

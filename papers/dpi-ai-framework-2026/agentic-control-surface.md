# DPI–AI Components and Agentic Control Surface

| Framework Element | What It Represents in Agentic Terms | Primary Risk Surface | Required Control Primitive |
|------------------|---------------------------------------|----------------------|---------------------------|
| AI Blocks | Callable tools the agent can invoke | Tool misuse or substitution | Signed artifacts, allowlists, capability-based access |
| DPI Workflows | Runtime policy orchestration | Policy drift, inconsistent execution | Versioned policies, conformance tests, runtime enforcement |
| Public Agents | Acting interface layer | Authority confusion, social engineering | Identity binding, disclosure, escalation pathways |

# Public-Agent Identity and Accountability Model

| Role | System Actor | Control Domain | Accountability Focus |
|------|--------------|---------------|----------------------|
| Issuer | Credential or entitlement authority | Right-to-act tokens | Correct issuance and revocation semantics |
| Verifier | Service validating claims | Acceptance criteria | False accept/reject, auditability |
| Controller | Ministry or agency | Purpose and workflow intent | Lawful basis, minimization, contestability |
| Governor | Ecosystem oversight body | Participation and certification rules | Conformance enforcement, incident arbitration |
| Beneficiary | Citizen or business | Rights and outcomes | Appeal access, transparency, remedy |

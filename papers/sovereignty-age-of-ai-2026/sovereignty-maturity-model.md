# Sovereignty Maturity Model
## Sequencing: Access → Adapt → Embed → Influence

**Purpose.** Many countries cannot “buy” sovereignty. They must sequence it.
This model turns the “sequenced dependence” pathway into a phased operating plan.

---

## Phase 1 — Access
**Objective:** secure predictable access to frontier capability without losing policy space.

Minimum outcomes:
- multi-year access agreements with audit/telemetry clauses
- baseline DPI rails for identity + authorization
- initial AI inventory + risk tiering

Key deliverables:
- posture declaration v0
- SARI baseline
- procurement clause kit (interop + exit rights)

Risk pattern:
- taker dependence (black-box systems, no telemetry)

---

## Phase 2 — Adapt
**Objective:** localize and constrain systems to national context.

Minimum outcomes:
- fine-tuned/open-weight models for priority languages/domains
- data trust institution for priority datasets
- runtime policy enforcement for high-impact workflows

Key deliverables:
- model registry + evaluation gates
- trace and redress services for priority programs

Risk pattern:
- “sovereignty as a service” (local wrapper, foreign control)

---

## Phase 3 — Embed
**Objective:** institutionalize governance and scale adoption.

Minimum outcomes:
- cross-government architecture function
- interoperability defaults in procurement
- recurring resilience drills and evaluation cadence

Key deliverables:
- national AI systems architecture
- continuous evaluation pipelines
- workforce capability coverage tracking

Risk pattern:
- scale without controls (silent compounding error)

---

## Phase 4 — Influence
**Objective:** shape markets and standards; convert capability into leverage.

Minimum outcomes:
- standards participation + regional bargaining blocs
- exportable reference implementations
- measurable public-sector AI performance + trust outcomes

Key deliverables:
- published interoperability profiles
- regional model consortium participation
- “sovereignty backlog” with tracked closures

Risk pattern:
- symbolic steering (rules without enforcement power)

---

## Graduation criteria (example)
A country SHOULD not claim Phase 3 without:
- successful annual exit drill for at least 1 mission-critical workload
- operational trace + redress for all high-impact workflows in scope
- quarterly SARI updates with improving trendlines
